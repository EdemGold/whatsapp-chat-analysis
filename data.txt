5/22/21, 2:21 PM - Gold: What are you learning?
5/22/21, 2:21 PM - Rex Anthony: I won't say I am specialized in one language. I use the right tool for the right job.

5/22/21, 3:40 PM - Gold: Ahhh
5/22/21, 3:40 PM - Gold: Explain more please
5/22/21, 7:23 PM - Rex Anthony: I am a maker. I create productivity tools for web developers
5/22/21, 7:48 PM - Gold: Ahh
5/22/21, 7:50 PM - Segun: Awesome 👍. You must be very diverse with stacks too.
5/22/21, 8:04 PM - Gold: What type of Dev tools
5/22/21, 8:10 PM - Rex Anthony: I created http://sharetxt.live for sharing text between your devices. About to release https://pageinsight.app a website analytics tool
5/22/21, 8:16 PM - Gold: Damn man
5/22/21, 8:16 PM - Gold: My bro @2349139933440 is a black chain developer and a crypto investor
5/22/21, 8:16 PM - Gold: He owns a crypto investment start up firm
5/22/21, 8:17 PM - Gold: But you're good man
5/22/21, 8:17 PM - Gold: So are you a back end or front end guy
5/22/21, 8:18 PM - Chivoma: See whines😹😹💔
5/22/21, 8:18 PM - Gold: Haha
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Rex Anthony: Full stack
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Gold: Bastard
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Gold: Damn you're chill bro
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Gold: So how did you begin
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Gold: Any advice for a beginner?
5/22/21, 8:20 PM - Gold: Did you get any internships?
5/22/21, 8:21 PM - Rex Anthony: I started with the basics
5/22/21, 8:22 PM - Rex Anthony: After grasping the core concepts, I set out to put to work what I have learnt
5/22/21, 8:22 PM - Gold: How did you put them into work
5/22/21, 8:22 PM - Gold: And how long did the basics take you ?
5/22/21, 8:23 PM - Rex Anthony: I didn't want to get trapped in the endless process of learning what I was never going to use.
5/22/21, 8:24 PM - Rex Anthony: I picked up some projects which I found interesting at the time. Probably not solving a real world problem, but something that I found fun working on
5/22/21, 8:25 PM - Rex Anthony: I would say I learnt more working on the project than I did reading a book or following a tutorial. This was hands on experience. The solution had to come from your mind, from your own thinking
5/22/21, 8:27 PM - Chivoma: Ok, that's chill
So how about internships
5/22/21, 8:28 PM - Gold: Bastard he's getting there na
5/22/21, 8:28 PM - Chivoma: Any mobile dev here 👀
5/22/21, 8:28 PM - Chivoma: Boss calm 😹
5/22/21, 8:28 PM - Gold: 😏... No call me boss again
5/22/21, 8:28 PM - Gold: Haha.... Me
5/22/21, 8:29 PM - Rex Anthony: My journey goes like 
QBasic-->C-->C++-->Java-->HTML-->CSS-->JavaScript-->Ajax-->SQL-->PHP and so on.

After grasping the initial concept of programming, it is easy to grab other things
5/22/21, 8:30 PM - Chivoma: 🙇🏿🙇🏿🙇🏿
5/22/21, 8:30 PM - Rex Anthony: I also did android. Once you know java it is easy
5/22/21, 8:30 PM - Gold: Haha..m guy you're embarrassing me😒😒😂
5/22/21, 8:30 PM - Gold: Interesting
5/22/21, 8:30 PM - Gold: Do you do ML?
5/22/21, 8:31 PM - Rex Anthony: No yet. It is an interesting area though
5/22/21, 8:31 PM - Chivoma: Google dev 🙇🏿🙇🏿
5/22/21, 8:32 PM - Chivoma: Fullstack chairman 💪🏾
5/22/21, 8:32 PM - Gold: Fuck you
5/22/21, 8:32 PM - Rex Anthony: Most python developers claim to own ML but there are libraries that you can use like tensorflow.js
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Gold: Really
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Gold: Explain more
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Rex Anthony: Basically, you can use the language that you know to do the same thing
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Chivoma: Javascript is actually very diverse finds application almost everywhere
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Rex Anthony: Absolutely
5/22/21, 8:33 PM - Chivoma: Explain more sha
5/22/21, 8:35 PM - Rex Anthony: Machine learning was natively developed for python. Every other variation of it is ported from python to other languages
5/22/21, 8:36 PM - Gold: Really?
5/22/21, 8:36 PM - Rex Anthony: But machine learning experts like Google, Microsoft etc, still use python in the background
5/22/21, 8:38 PM - Rex Anthony: I think the library was ported to other languages to make it accessible to developers who are not fluent in python. So that you can basically use the language to create and train your own machine learning models
5/22/21, 8:39 PM - Gold: Omo so tensorflow was ported?
5/22/21, 8:39 PM - Rex Anthony: Yes bro
5/22/21, 8:41 PM - Gold: Awesome
5/22/21, 8:42 PM - Gold: So you haven't said anything about internships and their impact
5/22/21, 8:43 PM - Rex Anthony: I believe that internships have their use in helping you understand how the industry work. Your roles and responsibilities and what part you play in product development.
5/22/21, 8:45 PM - Gold: So you had an internship?
5/22/21, 8:47 PM - Rex Anthony: Yes, I did an internship for 3 months at a europan company where I got exposed to skills in DevOps. It was a very fruitful experience. As I use those skills in my work today
5/22/21, 8:48 PM - Gold: Okay interesting

5/24/21, 1:55 PM - +234 803 974 7164: My name is Kayode, I am a tech newbie, I am a self taught web developer though along the line I've got some great mentors, I'm just about getting started with JavaScript not so versed but I have more than basic knowledge of it, my goal in the long run is to be a MERN fullstack developer
5/24/21, 1:55 PM - Gold: What technologies are you adept at
5/24/21, 1:55 PM - Gold: What technology do you use?
5/24/21, 1:56 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I use HTML CSS JavaScript for now I've not delved into frameworks like React Bootsrap and the likes but I hope so soonest
5/24/21, 1:56 PM - Chivoma: So you're web developer welcome man
5/24/21, 1:57 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Yeah I am

5/24/21, 1:57 PM - Chivoma: What are your tools currently?
5/24/21, 1:58 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I've replied
5/24/21, 1:58 PM - +234 803 974 7164: This are my current tools
5/24/21, 1:59 PM - Chivoma: Oh 
So sorry didn't see it🙇🏿
5/24/21, 2:00 PM - +234 803 974 7164: But currently I am working on becoming a CSS god so I don't have to write much JavaScript😉
5/24/21, 2:01 PM - Chivoma: Why is almost everyone leaving JS 😂
5/24/21, 2:01 PM - +234 803 974 7164: When i discovered with CSS you can achieve much so I had to join the train 😂
5/24/21, 2:05 PM - Gold: Start with bootstrap
5/24/21, 2:05 PM - Gold: It sort of lays the ground work for everything
5/24/21, 2:05 PM - Gold: Framework related of course
5/24/21, 2:44 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I did an overview of it though
5/24/21, 2:45 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Thanks I'll start from there
5/24/21, 2:46 PM - Gold: Yes
5/24/21, 2:46 PM - Gold: Good luck bro
5/24/21, 2:46 PM - Gold: I beleive you can make it
5/24/21, 2:47 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Thanks boss
5/24/21, 2:48 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I started from afresh again I mean from HTML based on the advise of my mentor and I'm getting better now
5/24/21, 2:48 PM - Gold: Yes
5/24/21, 2:48 PM - Gold: The basis if all frameworks or libraries is to get their fore language down
5/24/21, 2:48 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Yeah
5/24/21, 2:49 PM - Gold: Because all frameworks do is just make your work easier
5/24/21, 2:49 PM - +234 803 974 7164: And I believe one needs to understand HTML and CSS well b4 moving to Js cus JS is more like the advanced of both to me though
5/24/21, 2:51 PM - Gold: Okay
5/24/21, 2:51 PM - Gold: If you think so
5/24/21, 2:51 PM - Gold: Just go with whatever your gut tells you to
5/24/21, 2:52 PM - Gold: No developer journey will ever be the same
5/24/21, 2:52 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Apparently
5/24/21, 2:52 PM - +234 803 974 7164: And I am in love with my journey now

5/24/21, 3:07 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I wanted to be a data analyst before
5/24/21, 3:08 PM - +234 803 974 7164: But i discovered companies needing CS, business, economics background for such jobs in Nigeria that's why I diverted to web dev
5/24/21, 3:19 PM - Gold: Have you tried googling jobs?
5/24/21, 3:19 PM - Gold: Google gives you alerts for jobs
5/24/21, 3:26 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Yeah but then i wanted to intern
5/24/21, 3:26 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Now I'm in love with web dev though
5/24/21, 3:32 PM - Gold: Okay that's cool yoo
5/24/21, 3:32 PM - Gold: *too
5/24/21, 3:32 PM - Gold: Web dev is the most popular job in tech

5/26/21, 2:45 PM - +234 803 974 7164: What and what have you covered
5/26/21, 2:46 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Start by understanding wht JS does
5/26/21, 2:46 PM - Williams: Okay
5/26/21, 2:46 PM - +234 803 974 7164: It helps users to interact with a site way better than CSS
5/26/21, 2:47 PM - Williams: Js output, statement, syntax
5/26/21, 2:47 PM - Williams: Okay
5/26/21, 2:47 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Have you started working in the DOM
5/26/21, 2:48 PM - Williams: No. Following it sequentially as it is written in w3schools
5/26/21, 2:49 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Okay that's good
5/26/21, 2:49 PM - +234 803 974 7164: At first I did not understand what JS does too
5/26/21, 2:49 PM - Williams: Okay
5/26/21, 2:49 PM - +234 803 974 7164: So the point is what you are learning now are the fundamentals of js
5/26/21, 2:50 PM - +234 803 974 7164: It's alright that you are not getting it at first
5/26/21, 2:50 PM - +234 905 802 8858: 🌚
5/26/21, 2:50 PM - +234 803 974 7164: But just make sure you understand how the output syntax works
5/26/21, 2:50 PM - +234 803 974 7164: You will learn data types
5/26/21, 2:50 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Loops
5/26/21, 2:51 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Functions
5/26/21, 2:51 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Objects
5/26/21, 2:51 PM - +234 803 974 7164: So the knowledge of this things is what you will implement in the dom
5/26/21, 2:51 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Hmm...
5/26/21, 2:52 PM - Williams: Can you pls send me some links or video that helped you.
5/26/21, 2:52 PM - +234 803 974 7164: So the dom is Document Object Model it's like a tree of how the HTML appears
5/26/21, 2:52 PM - +234 803 974 7164: In the dom is where you will know how to integrate JavaScript to make it work with html and css
5/26/21, 2:53 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Check freecodecamp.org there you will see videos
5/26/21, 2:53 PM - +234 803 974 7164: You need videos
5/26/21, 3:54 PM - +234 809 379 2855: https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg
5/26/21, 3:54 PM - Williams: Thanks

5/26/21, 3:56 PM - +234 809 379 2855: The link above follows freecodecamp's tutorial.
5/26/21, 3:57 PM - +234 905 802 8858: For certification, you ca use scrimba
5/26/21, 3:58 PM - +234 809 379 2855: When you get a little understanding of it. Switch to scrimba
5/26/21, 3:58 PM - +234 809 379 2855: They have a free JavaScript course noe
5/26/21, 3:58 PM - +234 809 379 2855: Now

5/27/21, 9:17 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Check the code out

5/27/21, 9:18 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Not yet

5/27/21, 9:21 AM - Gold: Okay
5/27/21, 9:21 AM - Gold: Weldone again bro
5/27/21, 9:21 AM - Gold: Pushed it yet?
5/27/21, 9:21 AM - +234 803 974 7164: To github?
5/27/21, 9:22 AM - Gold: Yes
5/27/21, 9:22 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Not yet
5/27/21, 9:22 AM - +234 803 974 7164: It's in codepen
5/27/21, 9:22 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Do you have a codepen account
5/27/21, 9:23 AM - Gold: Haha.... Yes I do
5/27/21, 9:23 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Follow me please let me follow you back
5/27/21, 9:24 AM - Gold: Okay
5/27/21, 9:28 AM - +234 817 131 5756: Nice one bro. You can try using the nth-child() selector even without using classes.
5/27/21, 9:29 AM - +234 803 974 7164: I do not really know how the nth-child() works
5/27/21, 9:29 AM - +234 803 974 7164: I just made first two lines of the divs the rest copy and paste
5/27/21, 9:34 AM - +234 817 131 5756: Ok... div.nth-child(even){ background-color:black}
div.nth-child(odd){background-color:white}. It very useful when you want to style a document dynamically. If you have a grid item and you want to style each one differently. Try CSS trick or MDN for reference.
5/27/21, 9:35 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Okay thank you
5/27/21, 9:35 AM - +234 803 974 7164: The nth-child is giving me lil issues maybe because i do not really like it
5/27/21, 9:37 AM - +234 817 131 5756: I'll suggest you pause the tutorial and search for a project where all the concept you've learnt is applied. So you can understand how everything fits together.
5/27/21, 9:43 AM - +234 817 131 5756: Read the reference and you'll see how powerful it is. Let me give you an instances: let say you want to build a photo gallery app or or an image downloading web app like unsplash, how are you gonna style the grid items separately?
5/27/21, 9:45 AM - +234 803 974 7164: I'm not there yet
5/27/21, 11:16 PM - +234 813 110 8177: Maybe check this out

5/28/21, 8:50 PM - Emrys: Welcome once again
5/28/21, 8:53 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Thank you
5/28/21, 9:02 PM - Emrys: Welcome @2349032905929
5/28/21, 9:23 PM - +234 907 929 7785: Good evening devs in the house 😊
5/28/21, 9:28 PM - Emrys: Good evening sir

5/28/21, 9:43 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Good evening devs. I'm George. I write code in Python and JavaScript. I'm a full stack developer. Looking forward to collaborating with everyone here. Thanks
5/28/21, 9:47 PM - Segun: Welcome George, pleased to have you here.
5/28/21, 9:48 PM - Segun: Please if anyone has any issues with coding, they are free to put it here.

Anyone is free to help too. We are all learning.
5/28/21, 9:49 PM - Segun: Just about to use Tailwind.css for the first time here. 

Anyone ever worked with Tailwind.css here?? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
5/28/21, 9:50 PM - Chivoma: Share your achievements we are here to appreciate you also🤝🏿
5/28/21, 9:50 PM - Chivoma: Anyone?
5/28/21, 9:52 PM - +234 805 764 0156: Good evening everyone I'm Nathaniel! Fullstack developer with php and javascript
5/28/21, 10:06 PM - Segun: Welcome Nat. 🙌🙌
5/28/21, 10:07 PM - +234 805 764 0156: Thanks
5/28/21, 10:17 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I have, I built a dark mode desktop twitter clone site with it
5/28/21, 10:19 PM - Segun: Okay, what's the first thing to do to start using it.

Can you kind off explain the initial process, I know it's different from Bootstrap.
5/28/21, 10:25 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I installed it using npm but you could just use it with their CDN in the website. I was in their documentation most of the time but it's quite easy to get the hang of it.
5/28/21, 10:26 PM - Segun: Thanks bro.
5/28/21, 10:26 PM - Segun: Getting a good grasp of it
5/28/21, 10:28 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I'd love if anyone can help get the site to be responsive
5/28/21, 10:29 PM - +234 812 077 2330: This message was deleted
5/28/21, 10:29 PM - +234 812 077 2330: https://github.com/Thebuilderekes/twitter-clone
5/28/21, 10:29 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Pull it to netlify
5/28/21, 10:29 PM - +234 803 974 7164: And let it display as a site now
5/28/21, 10:33 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ok I think I will, right now its on github pages https://thebuilderekes.github.io/twitter-clone/
5/28/21, 10:34 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Very nice job man
5/28/21, 10:34 PM - +234 812 077 2330: It'll look messy right now because it's not responsive
5/28/21, 10:34 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I made a job too but
5/28/21, 10:35 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Tgw responsiveness is the issue I'll finish it tomorrow
5/28/21, 10:35 PM - +234 812 077 2330: ..If you're viewing on mobile
5/28/21, 10:35 PM - Segun: Will Netlify make it responsive?
5/28/21, 10:36 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Noooooo
5/28/21, 10:37 PM - +234 812 077 2330: No I have to either use tailwindcss classes or write the media queries in CSS to make it responsive
5/28/21, 10:38 PM - +234 803 974 7164: You can write the queries yourself
5/28/21, 10:38 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Learn to write without frameworks
5/28/21, 10:38 PM - +234 803 974 7164: That's what I'm battling I want to manipulate media queries so well
5/28/21, 10:38 PM - Segun: Omo😂😂
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Lol
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - Segun: Use w3schools, they explained it well.
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Yeah
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Very well
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Freecodecamp did too
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Media query can be messy
5/28/21, 10:39 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Well, the css is already in tailwindcss classes so I really don't know how I'd go about writing it in css
5/28/21, 10:40 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Oh then use it then
5/28/21, 10:40 PM - +234 907 929 7785: Use bootstrap for responsiveness naw
5/28/21, 10:40 PM - Segun: Here you go.

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp
5/28/21, 10:40 PM - +234 803 974 7164: One thing is i want to be a programmer and not a developer
5/28/21, 10:41 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I want to be able to build sites without frameworks
5/28/21, 10:41 PM - +234 814 135 2896: Bravo 👏
5/28/21, 10:41 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Can anyone explain difference between programmer and developer
5/28/21, 10:43 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Anyone interested in collaborating with me on this can give it a go @2348105729893 since you're already looking at tailwindcss, I'll really appreciate it.
5/28/21, 10:44 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Tailwind is good prolly better than bootstrap according to users
5/28/21, 10:50 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Yes it's really good
5/28/21, 10:50 PM - Segun: Yeah.. it's utility first, meaning they are concerned about the outlook and what you want the elements to do or feel like
5/28/21, 10:51 PM - Segun: Okay
5/28/21, 10:58 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Has anyone taught about audio dev talk rooms? Clubhouse is now both on Android and IOS and I joined today. It's a cool app and it seems like it consumes less data than other apps that use text, video and photo in my opinion. Like Twitter spaces, the audio room features can be easily used to create rooms centered around web development and programming talks just incase anyone is thinking to do it.
5/28/21, 10:58 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Thought*
5/28/21, 10:59 PM - Segun: Yeah it's a nice idea.. I'll prefer Twitter spaces, never used clubhouse though
5/28/21, 10:59 PM - Segun: We can organize a Twitter spaces here for everyone.
5/28/21, 11:01 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I kinda prefer club house because there's a bit of control to who can get access into the rooms if you're thinking of having a  room that is strictly on invite
5/28/21, 11:01 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Twitter spaces tends to allow just about anyone who finds the room to enter
5/28/21, 11:03 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Instead all of us could migrate to duo
5/28/21, 11:03 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Allows up to at least 30 folks in calls
5/28/21, 11:05 PM - Segun: Duo is not popularly used.
5/28/21, 11:05 PM - Segun: I get you bro.
5/28/21, 11:05 PM - Segun: Then we can fix both anyway.
5/28/21, 11:06 PM - Chivoma: I thought android users could only get an invite from iOS uses
5/28/21, 11:07 PM - Chivoma: Any flutter dev here 👀
5/28/21, 11:09 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I'm not sure about it but I did all my invites from an ios user so you might be correct
5/28/21, 11:10 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Get*
5/28/21, 11:10 PM - Chivoma: *users
5/28/21, 11:11 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I actually just started to look at dart today😁
5/28/21, 11:11 PM - Chivoma: With Android studio or VS code?
5/28/21, 11:13 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I was looking at a tutorial and the instructor was using replit online
5/28/21, 11:13 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Can it work in VS code?
5/28/21, 11:14 PM - Chivoma: Yup
Someone I know uses VS code
5/28/21, 11:14 PM - Segun: Same here
5/28/21, 11:17 PM - Chivoma: Twitter will soon add a ticket feature that may solve this
5/28/21, 11:17 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ok cool. It's a 3 hour tutorial and I'm just 20 minutes into it but I like the language already
5/28/21, 11:17 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ohh ok
5/28/21, 11:18 PM - Chivoma: 🙌🏿
5/28/21, 11:19 PM - Segun: I love the energy here guy.. 🙌

If anyone is feeling like "I have no idea of what these guys are talking about" it's not a problem.

No one completely does. Feel free to ask *anything*

Please!!!

You using a frameworks doesn't make u a bad developer or a lazy one
5/29/21, 8:53 AM - Segun: Yeah true. But learning how to be good without framework will make you a better developer
5/29/21, 9:12 AM - +234 701 332 9953: I don't think so there is a reason they created frameworks to make ur work easier
5/29/21, 10:05 AM - Segun: When you focus more on learning frameworks more than the languages, then you'll understand how tough it is using frameworks.

5/29/21, 4:14 PM - Emrys: Won't he still have to learn it
5/29/21, 4:15 PM - +234 803 974 7164: He needs to get used to code editor first
5/29/21, 4:15 PM - Emrys: Thats the best way because he will see his changes immediately
5/29/21, 4:15 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I know
5/29/21, 4:15 PM - Emrys: Then just refer to code editor and make changes
5/29/21, 4:15 PM - +234 803 974 7164: But I bet you he might not get it now
5/29/21, 4:16 PM - Emrys: You can't judge for him
5/29/21, 4:17 PM - +234 803 974 7164: Okay

5/29/21, 4:18 PM - Gold: @2348067974694 which would you be comfortable with
5/29/21, 4:18 PM - Gold: Console or the editor?
5/29/21, 4:18 PM - Williams: Editor
5/29/21, 4:19 PM - Emrys: That's better he chose for himself
5/29/21, 4:19 PM - Emrys: So as time goes on he'll get to see the advantages of console and stick with it
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Yup
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Okay so just make the changes they told you in your editor
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Emrys: Please let us always try and give all options so the person chooses his like
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I know we are chatting privately and he seems to be just starting out the whole thing
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Save your changes and then reload your page
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Okay
5/29/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: So he's not comfortable with it yet
5/29/21, 4:21 PM - Gold: It'll take him some time
5/29/21, 4:21 PM - Gold: It took me a while too to get it
5/29/21, 4:21 PM - +234 803 974 7164: I tell you man

5/29/21, 7:07 PM - Gold: When you want to contribute to open source
5/29/21, 7:07 PM - Gold: Contribute to those libraries you use a lot
5/29/21, 7:08 PM - Gold: So for front end I'm guessing you use bootstrap
5/29/21, 7:08 PM - Gold: So start with bootstrap
5/29/21, 7:08 PM - Gold: Or anyone else you want to
5/29/21, 7:08 PM - Gold: But let it be one you love a lot

6/1/21, 12:24 AM - Gold: Hmmm
6/1/21, 12:24 AM - Gold: Try Ctrl c to end the server
6/1/21, 12:25 AM - Gold: Then run a cls
6/1/21, 12:25 AM - Gold: Cls if it's a windows system of course
6/1/21, 12:39 AM - +234 913 390 9108: Thanks
6/1/21, 1:09 AM - Gold: Did it work
6/1/21, 7:10 AM - +234 913 390 9108: It worked, but some kept sticking there
6/1/21, 8:42 AM - Gold: AHHH
6/1/21, 8:42 AM - Gold: Try googling then
6/1/21, 10:49 AM - Rex Anthony: Actually, cls in windows or ls in Linux does not actually clear the screen, like delete everything. It just moves the content out of view.
If you scroll up, you will still see it
6/1/21, 10:50 AM - Rex Anthony: To actually clear the screen, close and reopen the terminal
6/1/21, 10:50 AM - Gold: Really?
6/1/21, 10:50 AM - Rex Anthony: Yep
6/1/21, 10:50 AM - Gold: 😂😂not elegant at all

6/1/21, 10:52 AM - +234 913 096 9252: git
6/1/21, 10:53 AM - Tarek: Did you edit anything inside the .git folder?

6/1/21, 11:00 AM - Rex Anthony: There are 2 approaches that you can take
1. Restore a backup of the git/config file
2. Rename the config file to config.bak

These should fix your issue
6/1/21, 11:02 AM - +234 913 096 9252: no i was trying to commit then i stopped it and now it's sending that error
6/1/21, 11:05 AM - Tarek: Yeah as said @2349034902480 you can try either 1 or 2, it might help you fix this

6/3/21, 4:55 PM - Gold: Not just now
6/3/21, 4:55 PM - Gold: They'll advertise when the tech becomes proliferated
6/3/21, 4:56 PM - Gold: <Media omitted>
6/3/21, 4:57 PM - Chivoma: My feel is that since it is a delicative process the adverts would still be there but not as the every day adverts we see maybe just Twitter marketing and stuff
6/3/21, 4:57 PM - Gold: Time
6/3/21, 4:58 PM - Chivoma: I actually believe in the technology especially when the chip was inserted in a Monkey and the monkey could play games on a computer with his mind so as @2347066985640 said Time shall tell

6/4/21, 8:29 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Hi @447398105965. First of all, kudos on your journey so far. Some people get discouraged while learning CSS and just quit.

Ok, I'd say the next step for you is to learn JavaScript. This is from my own personal experience. I started learning web development on freecodecamp.org and their curriculum started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and others.

There are other reasons why you should learn JavaScript but I want to make my comment as brief as possible.

👍

6/4/21, 4:56 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I'll like to share a couple tips that'll help you build a responsive website.
1: build for mobile first: it's much easier to adjust to other views if you build for mobile first. You might write little media queries if you build for mobile first.
2: set the body overflow-x to hidden. Having a your container or text overflowing the page isn't a good practice. The only exception to dis is if you want to implement an horizontal scroll effect, and you'll just need to set that container overflow-y property to auto.
3: use width plus Max-width. If you build for mobile first you can set a card to width:100%, since that card or container would still be 100% width on all screens, you can set the Max-width to let say 300px. On mobile view the width is 100% but on any wider device it's won't get bigger than 300px.
4: use rem, em, or % value over px. I prefer % for my child containers width and rem for padding and margins. The percentage value is better in my opinion, if you set your container to 90% wide l, it would remain 90% in all screen. Margin:0 auto to set it to the center.
6/4/21, 4:56 PM - +234 817 131 5756: You can add yours...
6/4/21, 5:00 PM - +44 7398 105965: Can you please give a video tutorial link on designing for mobile first.

6/4/21, 6:26 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Programming is about creativity, it isn't science. If a code works and is able to solve a problem I guess the person who coded it is a programmer. Where the problem comes in is the community view of clean code or conventions. Conventions are to make our code look better and reduce bug potential. If I don't understand most js concept I don't know think writing clean code matters. If you can code and building something with it then you are a developer, forget about clean code.

Get comfortable with html and css by building project and hosting it on github.

Just start, you'll figure everything out yourself.

6/4/21, 8:43 PM - Segun: Hi Agnes.

I did a introduction to Git in this thread on April 18,you can check it out. It covers installing and setting it up, very basic.

I also added some links to YouTube videos about using git there.

And to who's confused about the difference between Git and Github, if you read the comment under this tweet, you'll be very very clear about the difference. Here you go 👇

6/5/21, 10:54 AM - Segun: Same here
6/5/21, 10:56 AM - Gold: I'm sure soon they'll tell the Nigerian police to start searching phones for the  Twitter app and VPN apps🤦🏾‍♂️
6/5/21, 11:01 AM - Segun: I know right. And then we will figure out another app to hide VPN and Twitter app on phones.
6/5/21, 11:01 AM - Segun: 😂😂
6/5/21, 11:01 AM - Segun: The police knows very little of what the internet is capable of doing. Rest.

6/5/21, 11:02 AM - Gold: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
6/5/21, 11:02 AM - Segun: Twitter got banned, but it took just few hours and everyone is back on it! You think the government knows much about VPNs?

6/5/21, 1:58 PM - +91 91492 89689: is twitter blocked somewhere ??
6/5/21, 1:58 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Yes, Nigeria.
6/5/21, 1:59 PM - +91 91492 89689: good job they try to promote leftist agenda in every country
6/5/21, 1:59 PM - +234 902 383 0868: @2348067974694 check this out.
6/5/21, 1:59 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Precisely. It's all stupid politics.
6/5/21, 1:59 PM - +91 91492 89689: I hope India also ban Twitter
6/5/21, 1:59 PM - +91 91492 89689: True that
6/5/21, 2:00 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Why?
6/5/21, 2:00 PM - Williams: It's complicating. Had it earlier and it was working.uninstall and tried reinstalling it has been abortive.
6/5/21, 2:01 PM - +234 902 383 0868: It's working perfectly for me.
6/5/21, 2:01 PM - +91 91492 89689: they are promoting left by unethical means and are creating issues for for govt. precisely we need substitute of twitter we already developed a one but it will take time to get all features I suppose
6/5/21, 2:03 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Yes. It will. Twitter has been there for a while.
6/5/21, 2:04 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Over here, it was banned for a different reason though. The president's tweet got deleted by Twitter and next day, we hear Twitter will be banned.
6/5/21, 2:07 PM - +91 91492 89689: anyways it's irrevalent for development community so please ignore the message.
6/5/21, 2:11 PM - +91 91492 89689: similar issues they are going against democratically elected govt. to support those whom Indian people collectively thrown out of power and don't stand a chance to be back.
But our govt. is still too liberal to ban them 😅
6/5/21, 2:11 PM - Williams: <Media omitted>
6/5/21, 2:12 PM - +91 91492 89689: is VPN ban as well ??

6/5/21, 3:00 PM - Bayo: Hello Guys 🤗, what are you doing this weekend?

I have a gist for you 😜.

Do you know you can style the *HTML list tag*? I mean this tag *<li>*.

You can actually remove the default *dot and number* that comes with it and then turn them into wow-some styles.

 📢  *ANNOUNCEMENT BREAK*

*Thing of joy*

My last article *A B C of JavaScript Currying* got *Featured on Hashnode* (for the first time) 😱, which means that I am getting better at writing and other developers are finding more value from my blog content.

you can also check it out below 👇 (the badge is there ☺)

https://unclebigbay.com/a-b-c-of-javascript-currying

*Welcome back* 🙋‍♂️

Want to know more about styling the list tag like a pro? No need to *Google* 🤭

I have covered the basics in my newly published article on my blog with some examples to get you started.

you can check it out using the link below 👇

https://unclebigbay.com/using-html-lists-tag-like-a-pro

I will be waiting 😁

*I will also like to connect with you*

Don't forget to follow me on *Twitter* when you finally found a *VPN* 😂

6/5/21, 3:52 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Lol, oh I see. It's not as tyrannical as ours. You're lucky.
6/5/21, 4:46 PM - Segun: Have you created an account on  Windscribe.com?
6/5/21, 5:03 PM - Bayo: Same
6/5/21, 5:06 PM - +91 91492 89689: twitter is literally over stepping , removing verification from Vice President handle and RSS office holder handle is what it looks like they are demeaning the law of land and power holder , if they get banned in India as well I wouldn't feel bad instead there's opportunity of launching own similar social media platform without political biasness for exchange of thoughts
6/5/21, 5:07 PM - +91 76589 25527: *Agreed*  👍🏻
6/5/21, 5:08 PM - +234 902 383 0868: Oh wow... I see.

6/5/21, 5:16 PM - +91 91492 89689: they will ultimately get banned in tht case no ?? if they don't follow law of land why should they be allowed to earn from that place ?
6/5/21, 5:17 PM - +91 91492 89689: oh I see actually situation varies , I agree to your point but situation is kinda different here 😅
6/5/21, 5:18 PM - +91 91492 89689: If Twitter is allowed to operate freely they will mindwash people with their agenda , I am doing my B.Tech specialized in AI and ML and there's dedicated social engineering and it's process and impact in the course
6/5/21, 5:19 PM - +91 91492 89689: This is something which I don't want, I don't want my country people to be brainwashed by a profit making company agenda
6/5/21, 5:19 PM - +91 91492 89689: anyways not related to the community we should ignore this discussion😅
6/5/21, 5:21 PM - Segun: Reasons why India tried to ban Twitter is different from the reason Nigeria banned it.

Let's be clear of what we are talking about pls. True, Twitter has it's rules and so do the land. And both has to be respected.

6/5/21, 5:50 PM - Chivoma: Reason for the ban is different here @919149289689
6/5/21, 5:50 PM - Gold: Exactly
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - Gold: @919149289689 over here Twitter was was trying to enforce it's guidelines by deleting a potentially genocidal tweet which just happened to be tweeted by our president
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - Segun: Yes
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - Segun: Exactly!
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - +91 91492 89689: yeah I do understand that now 😅
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - Chivoma: The President's tweet was reported by Nigerians themselves not Twitter removing it
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - +91 91492 89689: I read some articles and situation
6/5/21, 5:51 PM - Gold: And by so doing they pissed him off and he and his cabinet decided to all Nigerians away from Twitter
6/5/21, 5:52 PM - Segun: I don't know why you haven't deleted your account on Twitter 😅
6/5/21, 5:52 PM - +91 91492 89689: Nigeria do have election no ?
6/5/21, 5:53 PM - Chivoma: @2347066985640 you tweeted today oh 😂😂
6/5/21, 5:54 PM - Gold: Omo guy are you going to do that?
6/5/21, 5:54 PM - Gold: 😂.... don't go there man
6/5/21, 5:54 PM - Gold: 😂😂😂... And I commented on buhari oh
6/5/21, 5:55 PM - Chivoma: 😂😂🤲🏽
6/5/21, 5:55 PM - +91 91492 89689: damn , this is actually bad Twitter is not the best platform but first govt. should try and negotiate terms like India is doing, after loosing the case in High Court against IT laws Twitter has agreed to follow rules which include action against those who do humiliation or spread hateful content, they need to give information to authorities know
6/5/21, 5:56 PM - +91 91492 89689: basically India would not tolerate some anonymous going rogue and doing illicit activities, they would face the law enforcement authorities
6/5/21, 5:56 PM - Segun: I have.
6/5/21, 5:56 PM - +91 91492 89689: like I read article saying about election ?

6/5/21, 6:02 PM - +91 91492 89689: dude do they seriously arrest someone for using Twitter ??
6/5/21, 6:02 PM - +91 91492 89689: even if they do ban Twitter under what logic they would arrest someone using it unless he is not promoting terrorism or some serious shit 😑
6/5/21, 6:03 PM - +91 91492 89689: what logic authorities would present in court and before magistrate ??
6/5/21, 6:04 PM - Segun: Confirm your mail
6/5/21, 6:06 PM - Chivoma: They check your phone using the police
6/5/21, 6:06 PM - Gold: Serious?
6/5/21, 6:06 PM - Gold: What about all your followers you just lost them
6/5/21, 6:06 PM - Gold: Haha, over here they don't operate with logic

6/5/21, 8:56 PM - Segun: I used Net Ninja's YouTube videos. If you are tired about the same look Bootstrap gives, I'll recommend Tailwind for you.
6/5/21, 8:56 PM - Segun: Thanks 🙌🙌

6/5/21, 9:02 PM - +234 813 110 8177: Boss 🙌🏽 🙌🏽 😊 nice to see you 😊
6/5/21, 9:03 PM - Gold: But Sha Bootstrap is too well bootstrapy
6/5/21, 9:04 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Do you have any online tutorials you recommend for tailwind?
6/5/21, 9:05 PM - Segun: Yeah
6/5/21, 9:05 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I built a photo gallery with tailwind and pexels API. I wrote an article on how to set Tailwind and parcel bundler.
6/5/21, 9:05 PM - Segun: Same here
6/5/21, 9:06 PM - Gold: I guess everyone did
6/5/21, 9:08 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I did not o. I learnt bootstrap after I was comfortable with plain CSS. I didn't build any project with bootstrap.
6/5/21, 9:12 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Nice one bro... I like the hover effect on the cards.
6/5/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: 😂😂😂
What I don't like about it is that you can easily tell if a site used bootstrap.
6/5/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: Search for Net Ninja's Tailwind video on YouTube
6/5/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: Share links.
6/5/21, 10:14 PM - Segun: <Media omitted>
6/5/21, 10:15 PM - Gold: 😂😂... actually..
But there was once I used both bootstrap and one other css framework together . It was really awesome...but in production they contradicted, their APIs😂
6/5/21, 10:16 PM - Gold: Tailwind?
6/5/21, 10:20 PM - Segun: Yeah
6/5/21, 10:20 PM - Segun: Thanks man
6/5/21, 10:21 PM - Segun: Ofcourse frameworks after being comfortable with plain css

if you're a frontend engineer, you already know building a *hamburger menu* is something you cannot run away from, especially when your client wants a custom one.


Allow me to introduce to you the world's simplest hamburger ever made with few lines of CSS. (*verified*)

you can check it out below and let me know what you think

which country are you tweeting from? 😂

On a serious note, do you know most people have lost their private information to bad guys due to fake VPN installations? 😲

On the second hand, let's take a look into why Twitter was banned in Nigeria and how you can access your twitter application using a trusted and reliable DNS application called 1.1.1.1 Warp.

You can check it out below 👇

6/6/21, 7:19 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Content, comment. P and N at the bottom
6/6/21, 7:22 PM - Emrys: Content is the stuff you are reading.
Comment is for commenting as the name implies.
P means previous and will load the devious post before the one you are reading
N means next which will load the next post .
If there is no previous or next it will be disabled
6/6/21, 7:26 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Basically what is the function of the app?
6/6/21, 7:30 PM - Emrys: For programming snippets and also electronics
6/6/21, 7:33 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Ok... I get now. The only thing I notice is your app is hard to understand. Like one can not navigate freely without help. In all the app functions pretty well and it's coolol. Nice one.
6/6/21, 7:35 PM - Emrys: P and N won't work because that's the only post still there

6/7/21, 2:48 PM - +234 817 131 5756: My fave part: According to a study published recently in the journal of Academy of Management Discoveries, people discover their best "aha!", "Eureka!", "Oh my God, it's so clear to me now!", "Why didn't I think of this earlier!" moments when they are doing 'boring' tasks like doing the laundry, washing the dishes, taking a shower (not sure this is a boring task, but then again who says it isn't ;) ).

Recommendations for developers applying for jobs.

1. It is better to send a job application mail with a relatable subject and brief introduction of yourself as against sending your cv without any introduction.
You don't have to be a great writer, just let the recipient/organization know why you are sending the email, your strength, portfolio links and why you should be considered in simple English.

2. It is not cool to send inbox messages to show interest in a job on social media by just sending "hi".
Tell the person why you are inboxing them.
Saying "Good morning" alone is not enough.

3. It is good to have your source code on GitHub and refer employers to see it. It is better to also have it live so prospective employer who may not be too techy can see a live preview of your works.
It helps to demonstrate that you know how to deploy to a live server beyond coding which is also a skill.

Let me stop here.

How are you doing today?

*All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy* and as a developer we do not want to be like *Jack* 😫 but like *Jackie Chan* 😎

That is why I bring to you in my latest article, *10 websites you should visit while not coding*, I promise it will be fun 🤗.

*Link:*  https://unclebigbay.com/10-websites-you-should-visit-when-you-are-not-coding

*Meanwhile,*

My friends and I are organizing a talk on *Saturday* from *7pm to 9pm*, where we will be discussing about JavaScript (anything on JavaScript) and probably build something together 💃.

This meetup focuses on individual developer use of JavaScript and JavaScript best practices, this is a meetup for both beginners, mid-levels and pro developers 😊 since we are all going to learn.

We will love to have you join us as we share knowledge.

If you're interested, kindly fill this form to have you on our list of friends 🤗.

6/11/21, 2:17 PM - +212 665-154541: Hi people, any react developers in here? Im struggling with a project regarding useState and animations
6/11/21, 2:27 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Share the problem.
6/11/21, 2:31 PM - +212 665-154541: <Media omitted>
6/11/21, 2:31 PM - +212 665-154541: More details :

I have an Item component that has the item information fetched from an API. The functionality is working fine, as in when I click "Add to cart" it adds the item to the cart on the top right.
6/11/21, 2:35 PM - +234 817 131 5756: What animation do you want to trigger on click?
6/11/21, 2:36 PM - +212 665-154541: An empty rectangle goes from the button clicked to the cart on the top right. It's like an "Add to Cart" animation
6/11/21, 2:37 PM - +212 665-154541: then disappears on arrival
6/11/21, 2:48 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Just a suggestion. Onclick on the button adds the item to cart. If you write a function that adds the animation on click and removes it on a set time out. Onclick would not only adds the item to the cart but also call the animation function. Onclick would call a  function containing both the add to cart functionality and the animation. But the animation function would add and remove the animation at a set time out
6/11/21, 2:49 PM - +234 817 131 5756: The probs would be how to manage state for the animation.
6/11/21, 2:51 PM - +212 665-154541: I'm stuck with implementing the states that's the thing. I can you send you the Item component's code if you want
6/11/21, 2:52 PM - +212 665-154541: Thanks for the suggestion, that should be the thought process yes. It's the implementation where I'm struggling
6/11/21, 2:53 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Plz send it. Even if I don't have a quick solution.

6/12/21, 2:20 PM - Bayo: Hello everyone 👋,

Did you know the browser scrollbar can be given a background color? ( I know you're looking at me like this 😏)

Did you also know that it can be replaced with a gif, image, and even with a linear gradient style? (Now like 😲)

If you don't know, - no qualms 😊

My newly published article contains explanations on how this can be achieved with 10 samples of different custom scrollbar with code snippets that you can use in your next project 💃.

Let's use this weekend to learn something new.

See you in the article 🏃‍♂️.

6/13/21, 3:17 PM - Gold: Hmmmm, I used the IBM Watson platform to build it, but maybe I can build my own display. I'll call you to help. I'll return the answers using the API. I'll call you when I'm ready to deploy
6/13/21, 3:18 PM - Gold: I'll do it. thanks bros
6/13/21, 3:18 PM - Gold: So did anyone get errors

6/13/21, 5:54 PM - +234 812 077 2330: It replies if you type something, nice! I'm guessing it checks for keywords in whatever question you ask it and then gives pre-programmed answers that corresponds to the keyword in your question? I've always wanted to have one of these on a website I create, I'd love to see the final result when you're done creating it. It's looking good, nice👏🏻
6/13/21, 6:42 PM - Bayo: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️Hello Everyone 👋,

I thought of sharing an article with you on my personal portfolio which I built as my last birthday gift 

(😏 this guy don come again).

And what will you gain from it 🤷‍♂️.

In this article, I explained how I was able to achieve the following 👇

1. Optimized the site performance to 96%
2. Accessibility up to 94%
3. Rated 93% in web best practice
4. 100% SEO and 
5. Why personal branding is important for every developer

This article also contains a detailed explanation of why each component of the portfolio is designed the way they are, which can also help you in building and optimizing your portfolio as a developer.

Below is the link to the article 👇.

I also wrote an article on *Personal Branding* you can read it here 👇

See you in the articles 🏃‍♂️
6/13/21, 6:42 PM - Gold: It's really cool and it learns from users words
6/13/21, 6:44 PM - Gold: But it also had different skills like a search skill,
6/13/21, 6:44 PM - Gold: Which searches from a predefined knowledge base with a definite source of data to answer queried questions
6/13/21, 6:44 PM - Gold: And an action skill too
6/13/21, 6:44 PM - Gold: It's a really cool chatbot platform
6/13/21, 6:45 PM - Gold: It's way better than dialogflow

6/13/21, 11:50 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Oh wow I actually set max-width to 100vw, could this be the reason why?
6/13/21, 11:51 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Not possible
6/13/21, 11:52 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Max-width can only affect the width but the height
6/13/21, 11:53 PM - +234 905 802 8858: What's the issue gangan?
6/13/21, 11:53 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Can overflow: hidden affect it?

6/13/21, 11:59 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Check overflow y if it is hidden
6/13/21, 11:59 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Ok
6/13/21, 11:59 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Or you can share the code with us
6/14/21, 12:01 AM - Segun: It's taking the full page and scroll bar is hidden?
6/14/21, 12:15 AM - +234 812 077 2330: The overflow:hidden was the problem, its scrolling now that I've taken it out🙌🏻

6/16/21, 6:09 PM - +91 98602 74568: An opinion based question. Bootstrap or Angular Material. Which one to choose?
6/16/21, 6:19 PM - +234 706 436 5293: Evening everyone
6/16/21, 6:24 PM - +91 99968 05784: Bootstrap is frame work for css and angular is for JavaScript 🙃
6/16/21, 6:24 PM - +91 99968 05784: Btw react is more in demand i think
6/16/21, 6:25 PM - +91 98602 74568: angular material is also CSS framework by google. I am looking for pointers which one of these 2 is better.
6/16/21, 6:26 PM - +91 99968 05784: Oh i didn't know actually i am still learning 😅
6/16/21, 6:27 PM - +91 98602 74568: its ok :)
6/16/21, 6:28 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Material UI?
6/16/21, 6:28 PM - +91 98602 74568: yes
6/16/21, 6:31 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I've used bootstrap and I don't like the framework. I haven't use material UI. If you're using it with a Js framework I guess material UI is your best bet.

You can check out the final project you will learn to build here 👇

What do you guys think? 🤔
6/18/21, 12:46 PM - +234 814 511 8879: This should be good💯.

6/18/21, 3:10 PM - Emrys: Yes
6/18/21, 3:10 PM - +91 98602 74568: Weekends should be good!

6/18/21, 3:19 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Evening by 4pm would make sense. https://twitter.com/Newt_Dev
6/18/21, 3:20 PM - Gold: Isn't 4 too early
6/18/21, 3:20 PM - Gold: A lot of us work and well that would be too early
6/18/21, 3:20 PM - Gold: Why not 7
6/18/21, 3:20 PM - Emrys: https://twitter.com/emrysqeens

6/18/21, 3:21 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Well, I don't work on weekends though. 7pm 👍
6/18/21, 3:22 PM - +234 806 490 1390: 7pm is fine
6/18/21, 3:22 PM - Gold: Okay 7pm it is then
6/18/21, 3:22 PM - Gold: Does anyone have any complaints for 7pm on Saturday?
6/18/21, 3:24 PM - +27 68 266 9415: U mean Nigeria time,?
6/18/21, 3:25 PM - +27 68 266 9415: K here seems we one hour apart so it's ok....
6/18/21, 3:25 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Yeah... It would be very late in India I guess. 12am maybe
6/18/21, 3:27 PM - Gold: Yup Nigerian time
6/18/21, 3:27 PM - Gold: It will?
6/18/21, 3:27 PM - Temi: Followed back

6/18/21, 3:30 PM - Gold: What did you use?
6/18/21, 3:30 PM - Gold: So I spoke to segun and we've agreed
6/18/21, 3:30 PM - Gold: Because of the indians here
6/18/21, 3:31 PM - Gold: We'll move it to 7pm Sunday
6/18/21, 3:33 PM - Gold: Because if we keep it at 7pm Saturday it will be 11pm in India and that will inconvenience our indian brothers so I feel we should work with 7pm Sunday so it will be 11pm Saturday in India
6/18/21, 3:33 PM - Gold: And that will probably be more comfortable for them
6/18/21, 3:33 PM - Gold: What do you guys think?
6/18/21, 3:33 PM - Gold: @2348083826262 boss out mouth oh

6/18/21, 4:02 PM - +234 813 110 8177: <Media omitted>
6/18/21, 4:05 PM - Segun: Amos is a boss! I'm sure you have done something nice too..
6/18/21, 4:08 PM - Segun: So Gold concerning the time for the space, you said tomorrow won't work right?
6/18/21, 4:11 PM - Segun: And time zone is a big issue truly.

We have Ghanians, South Africans, Indian and Nigerians here with all 4 different time zones.

I think India is the big issue because they are 4 hours ahead of Nigeria.

Ghana is 1 hour behind, South Africa is 1 hour ahead so it's a bit close.

I think 6pm or 7pm should favour us all? Still suggestions tho.
6/18/21, 4:11 PM - Segun: Gold pls help sort the timings out. You'll be good at this.
6/18/21, 4:12 PM - Segun added +234 703 969 4748, +234 706 329 6470, +234 811 429 7496, +234 905 354 7846, and +234 909 602 6989
6/18/21, 4:14 PM - Gold: No problem boss
6/18/21, 4:14 PM - Gold: I think 7 on Saturday should be okay for all of us then
6/18/21, 4:14 PM - Gold: So segun you're going to start the space right?
6/18/21, 4:17 PM - Segun: Okay, tomorrow? No problem.
If anyone is not okay with it, they can talk.

I'm fine with it Gold.
6/18/21, 4:17 PM - Segun: Anyone can. But it's okay, I'll host it..
6/18/21, 4:19 PM - Gold: Okay then
6/18/21, 4:19 PM - Gold: So it's settled everyone
6/18/21, 4:19 PM - Gold: By 7 tommorow we will have a Twitter space and in that space we'll talk about a variety of issues
6/18/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Involving the Nigerian tech space
6/18/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: How to build an audience in Twitter
6/18/21, 4:20 PM - Segun: So now let's be clear on the discussion.
6/18/21, 4:20 PM - Gold: Even the current crowwe issue sef

6/18/21, 4:23 PM - Chivoma: Twitter space great idea
6/18/21, 4:23 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Last year, during HNGi7, I use my second laptop just to open tabs and make research on a paricular project while i use d other to execute the project.........

6/18/21, 4:24 PM - Chivoma: More of a ghost guy during spaces just listen haven't actually spoken on one before  but it's a good idea
6/18/21, 4:24 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Yeap
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - Gold: If you're using windows check out your task manager when you're using chrome you'll be shocked
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - Gold: The point is you know a lot about them
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - Gold: How long should it be?
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Lol, my chrome uses more than a gb sometimes
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - +234 814 135 2896: @Hades_tech
6/18/21, 4:25 PM - +234 905 802 8858: An hour or two
6/18/21, 4:26 PM - Gold: Okay that's a good suggestion
6/18/21, 4:26 PM - Gold: Anyone else have any other suggestions or are we going to go for an hour or two?
6/18/21, 4:27 PM - Chivoma: 1 hour should be ok
6/18/21, 4:27 PM - Gold: Okay
6/18/21, 4:27 PM - +234 909 602 6989: Can someone resend this i just joined
6/18/21, 4:27 PM - Gold: Okay
6/18/21, 4:28 PM - Gold: *Hello everyone, I'm thinking of organizing a Twitter space for us here*

Discussion can be:

Building an online presence
Blogging content ideas
Networking as a dev
Finding opportunities

What do you guys think? 🤔
6/18/21, 4:29 PM - Gold: So let's go for middle ground
6/18/21, 4:29 PM - Gold: The space will last for a maximum of 1hour 30mins
6/18/21, 4:29 PM - Gold: Then we'll just let the topic flow freely
6/18/21, 4:30 PM - Gold: So for summary:
The space is scheduled for tomorrow at 7 and will be for a maximum of 1hour 30mins
6/18/21, 4:30 PM - Gold: Any objections?
6/18/21, 4:31 PM - Williams: I have a suggestion pls..Can I go ahead?
6/18/21, 4:31 PM - +234 814 135 2896: Good

6/18/21, 4:36 PM - Segun: Big one
6/18/21, 4:36 PM - Segun: Yeah bro. Pls contribute and help make it a success.
6/18/21, 4:37 PM - Williams: I idea is cool.I'll definitely be on that space.But, my suggestion is can we make out time in the space to talk to those of us that are still much young in this community trying to navigate our way.At least that will give us a since of belonging. Because, personally sometime we feel that this platform is for" professionals" if I should use that word.So,we tend to shy away and be passive here.But,would appreciate it more if we are carried along.
6/18/21, 4:38 PM - Williams: That is my humble submission.
6/18/21, 4:43 PM - Segun: Thanks for this open suggestions. I understand this.

To be honest, sometimes I feel the same way here. Believe that. The thing is this group is a community of those learning web development, so no matter the experience level everyone is welcomed here.
6/18/21, 4:48 PM - Segun: In all groups like this, it's always easy to feel intimadated. You'll always find those who know more than you and those you know more than.

But this doesn't matter at all, there are many people here I don't know half of what they know like @33605925551 @2347066985640 @2349058028858 @2348083826262 and many more, I see it as an opportunity to learn from these guys not a feeling of intimidation.
6/18/21, 4:48 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I think this is a great idea👏🏻

6/18/21, 4:52 PM - Williams: Very true..couple of persons here has been an immerse help...
6/18/21, 4:54 PM - +234 905 802 8858: You na my boss, Honestly speaking tho, we have a lot to learn from ourselves, if u're finding it difficult to learn or u have problem with your code not working, reach pout here, we dy here to support ourselves

6/18/21, 4:56 PM - +234 905 802 8858: We are all Junior Web Dev.
6/18/21, 4:56 PM - Segun: Yes exactly. Everyone is trying to help each other out. True that you might think some people here actually know way more than you know. But I can guarantee you that everyone's struggling with something.
6/18/21, 4:59 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I think a weekend will be fine to host the space. it'll be nice to have an introduction session in the space where we get to share our journey into web development/programming as a junior web devs. No matter our levels of knowledge, I think it'll help in networking and it will be quite encouraging to anyone, beginner or not, to hear each other's story.
6/18/21, 4:59 PM - Segun: It's a journey, some ahead of us, some behind, but we keep moving and helping each other out.

That's the aim of the group. So don't feel intimadated or looking down on yourself. Share your issues or what you know and you'll be surprised how many people here want to learn from you.
6/18/21, 5:02 PM - +1 (236) 869-3996: Hi Guys... This is Rahul and I am from India, but living in Canada. I would love to join the space(if my time permits )... Thanks for having me on this group 😁
6/18/21, 5:27 PM - +234 909 602 6989: Space link should be posted here when hosted please. I might not see it on my tl

6/18/21, 5:44 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I create lists to direct my focus on twitter, check out my web dev and programming list.
6/18/21, 6:06 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Let's me say dis. While we are all about using Twitter space and all that. I want to add something I think I'll want to do or want someone to talk about. 

 Open source project.

 Personally I don't enjoy using Twitter. I only go there to source for resources, but I think if we can also include something more engaging like an open source project where every member here can make contributions plus the discuss other stuff on Twitter space, I think it would make sense. So we don't only talk, we also act.
6/18/21, 6:10 PM - +27 68 266 9415: Tru
6/18/21, 6:11 PM - +234 817 131 5756: We can also include Job opportunities and  tips on dis group on WhatsApp.
6/18/21, 7:35 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I agree

6/18/21, 7:59 PM - +234 803 199 4429: This is how I feel too. I feel like the group is too advanced for me as I am a starter.
6/18/21, 8:12 PM - +234 817 131 5756: We are all learning. The  difference is the number of years we've put in. You can compare Thomas who is learning CSS to Segun or Gold or Queen who have spent more than a year building apps and solving problems with their preferred language. Try focus on your progress. 

Imposter syndrome affect the best of us.
6/18/21, 8:18 PM - +234 701 882 5886: This is the right word 🥺🥺🥺🤲🏻
6/18/21, 8:19 PM - +234 701 882 5886: You don’t get the point

Topics for beginners are not treated at all here and we tend to just keep mute coz we can’t contribute
6/18/21, 8:20 PM - +234 808 627 9501: I feel the same way too

I just think the best thing is for we, starters, to begin to communicate more since we all can see how much we are

A good amount of us on this group are just starting out 

We can try to create challenges, work on project share our knowledge also

We need to communicate more

You are not alone
6/18/21, 8:23 PM - +234 701 332 9953: 👏🏼👏🏼
6/18/21, 8:24 PM - +234 701 882 5886: So for us the starters, we can only listen more than talking during the Twitter space
6/18/21, 10:04 PM - Gold: @2348105729893 boss apply
6/18/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: Thanks man.
6/18/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: This is true.
6/18/21, 10:13 PM - Segun: Really?? Oh🥺
6/18/21, 10:14 PM - Segun: True, I understand. We'll fix this.
6/18/21, 10:15 PM - +234 913 292 5682: Thanks😊
6/18/21, 10:18 PM - Segun: Best advice ever. 🔥🔥

I think sometimes yeah, discussions here are more than the basics, I know. But the best way to gain out of this group is by contributing.

Talk to someone here.
Tag someone a question?
Explain a problem you're facing.
Show up constantly.
Send a picture of what you've done.
6/18/21, 10:20 PM - Segun: Just get noticed here.

It might look awkward at first. But do it consistently for a week and you'd get used to it.

It's a community, not a stage. You're here to contribute.

6/18/21, 10:33 PM - Segun: It's nice, Arike. It's really great for testing things out. Like you using that for testing out HTML CSS properties
6/18/21, 10:34 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Nice one.. I like the say you position the elements on the screen. The only suggestion from my end would be to improve on the link.

6/18/21, 10:43 PM - +234 701 882 5886: I still don’t get the box
6/18/21, 10:44 PM - Segun: You mean css box model?

6/18/21, 11:09 PM - Segun: Please do. That's the only way you'll find this group interesting. You can also help someone too.
6/18/21, 11:10 PM - +234 701 882 5886: Alright
Thank you 🙇‍♀️
6/18/21, 11:12 PM - Segun: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp

This will help you for box model. It's just about margin, border, padding of an html element.

Read this explanation from w3schools.com feel free to let me know anything you don't understand, but it's clear. I learned css from scratch here.

6/19/21, 12:01 AM - Gold: Even I feel impostor syndrome sometimes
6/19/21, 12:02 AM - Gold: In this field we chose it's inevitable I mean do you know how may java Script frameworks are being released daily
6/19/21, 12:03 AM - Gold: We work in a fast paced field so it's perfectly natural to feel like you're not worth being here
6/19/21, 12:03 AM - Gold: You just have to focus on being as good as you can
6/19/21, 12:04 AM - Gold: Besides the most successful tech entrepreneurs aren't those who know how to code it's actually those who know how to be creative and who can get the help of the really smart and creative people
6/19/21, 12:04 AM - Gold: Do you think Jeff bezos wrote any major piece of code for the Amazon website,
6/19/21, 12:05 AM - Gold: I can bet you all here that every single one of us here can write the first version of the Facebook web app
6/19/21, 12:05 AM - Gold: It was very simple
6/19/21, 12:05 AM - Gold: But it wasn't the tech or the elegance of the code that mattered it was the idea
6/19/21, 12:07 AM - Gold: If you see someone who's better than you here be friends with that person and then you can learn from that person even you're not as smart as that person you can still enlist the person to help or something. I had issues with hosting and @emrys does all the hosting for me
6/19/21, 12:08 AM - Gold: As programmers our major goal is to solve problems not write the best code, build the most beautiful site or master a new framework the only reason why we do these is to solve problems. So stop focusing on how good your code is and focus on how you can use your code to help humanity
6/19/21, 12:09 AM - Gold: And if you feel you have an idea you can't solve because of your skill level then aka someone here for help so they can help you

6/19/21, 8:46 AM - Segun: Thanks @2347066985640 that's it
6/19/21, 9:16 AM - Emrys: You can even solve everything if you research and  ask questions and don't give up.
6/19/21, 9:37 AM - Gold: Exactly man
6/19/21, 9:37 AM - Gold: It's by 7pm oh😅
6/19/21, 9:57 AM - Williams: Good morning Fam.I'm trying how do I make the background of the home page different from that of the about page
6/19/21, 9:58 AM - +234 803 974 7164: It's not hard now you should have separate css files for both pages I think
6/19/21, 9:58 AM - +234 803 974 7164: You can't use one css file for both pages
6/19/21, 10:00 AM - Williams: But, the tutorial i watched they made use of one CSS file for both pages
6/19/21, 10:02 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Then follow them
6/19/21, 10:04 AM - Temi: Yeah.. This works for me
6/19/21, 10:06 AM - +44 7398 105965: I think there are many ways to solve problems. Stick to what works for you. Using a single css file makes things easy as a beginner. My opinion though.
6/19/21, 10:07 AM - +234 803 974 7164: That's what i do
6/19/21, 10:07 AM - Emrys: You can but it's not proper
6/19/21, 10:08 AM - Emrys: If you are using images
6/19/21, 10:08 AM - Williams: <Media omitted>
6/19/21, 10:09 AM - Temi: I think it's even more complex using a single css file as a beginner, in my opinion. It's much easier to just have separate files
6/19/21, 10:09 AM - +44 7398 105965: Use an Id
6/19/21, 10:09 AM - +44 7398 105965: Maybe me
6/19/21, 10:09 AM - Emrys: Give each style separate class name
6/19/21, 10:10 AM - +234 701 882 5886: Having separate file for css makes it more easy and less complex
6/19/21, 10:11 AM - Emrys: And give each container the class name depending on which of the two style you want to use.
6/19/21, 10:14 AM - Emrys: CSS
.about{ define your style}
.home { define your style}

home.html
<body class = 'home'>

about.html
<body class = 'about'>
6/19/21, 10:14 AM - +44 7398 105965: Exactly what I was trying to say.
6/19/21, 10:16 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Sorry but will there any difference in using double quotes or single quote when writing a class name?
6/19/21, 10:16 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Both will still work the same right?
6/19/21, 10:16 AM - +234 909 603 5283: Yes
6/19/21, 10:18 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Thanks
6/19/21, 10:19 AM - +234 909 603 5283: Actually it's more easier using a single css file as a BEGINNER
6/19/21, 10:28 AM - Temi: Okay 🙏🏽

Don't forget to like, leave a feedback in the comment section, and share (that's one way to support my blog 🙏)
6/19/21, 12:17 PM - Segun: When I was just learning css, I stucked with single css file which is the proper way, but using separate file will be easier but it's not professional and you'll soon find it harder to navigate between those files when your codes get much.
6/19/21, 12:20 PM - Segun: This is better.

But if you find separate pages easier for you, use it till you get comfortable with css.

But know you won't continue like that, one file for your css project is the best, it makes your files clean and makes your site faster.
6/19/21, 12:29 PM - Gold: Hey everyone I posted a chatbot a few days ago and you guys gave suggestions about how it could improve and I integrated those improvements to the best of my ability.

6/19/21, 2:22 PM - Williams: Would that make a difference in same CSS file?
6/19/21, 2:33 PM - +234 812 077 2330: hello everyone. I was just thinking about how it'll be nice to get a JavaScript course that focuses on only DOM manipulation.
6/19/21, 2:36 PM - +234 810 618 9445: I like this

6/19/21, 2:40 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I cant seem to find any course like this online. Most of the JavaScript courses take a much broader approach in teaching JavaScript
6/19/21, 2:41 PM - +234 806 490 1390: I'm  sure netninja will guide you.  The tutorials helped me understand the dom better.

6/19/21, 4:01 PM - +234 810 618 9445: I will🤣
6/19/21, 4:03 PM - Segun: No problem
My bosses full here. 😂
6/19/21, 4:03 PM - +234 810 618 9445: Please in CSS, how can I place an image and <p> beside each other? I've been trying for the past 1 hr
6/19/21, 4:03 PM - +234 810 618 9445: ?
6/19/21, 4:05 PM - Segun: You can either use float, grid and Flexbox
6/19/21, 4:05 PM - Segun: Img float right 50%
P float right 50%

Edit as you want
6/19/21, 4:06 PM - +234 810 618 9445: OK , thank you
6/19/21, 4:06 PM - Segun: Use float if it's not too complex.

But grid and Flexbox will handle it better. Check w3schools for properties.
6/19/21, 4:08 PM - Segun: img{
float: right;
width: 50%;
}

Something like this.
6/19/21, 4:10 PM - +234 810 618 9445: This Worked🤦🏾‍♀️thanks

The link could he shared and we all migrate there. 

Just thinking  out loud.
6/19/21, 8:40 PM - +234 701 882 5886: I think the network discouraged people

6/19/21, 8:44 PM - Segun: Should we switch to zoom?

6/19/21, 9:39 PM - Segun: Yes.
6/19/21, 9:40 PM - +234 806 490 1390: How about Google Meet? 

I think it's  a good alternative to Zoom.
6/19/21, 9:40 PM - +234 701 882 5886: How does that work
6/19/21, 9:40 PM - +234 703 983 1390: But….why people no join the zoom meeting sef?😂☺️

6/19/21, 9:42 PM - +234 806 490 1390: You could download the app from play store or App Store. 

I think you might need a gmail. 

But overall it works akin to Zoom.
6/19/21, 9:49 PM - Segun: The space audio is cut off when you become a speaker.

It will only be recorded successfully if you are a listener.
6/19/21, 9:49 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Google meet is another good one
6/19/21, 9:52 PM - Eke: I'll figure out how to fix that issue.
6/19/21, 9:52 PM - +234 812 077 2330: To join the meeting on Google Meet, click this link:

6/20/21, 8:36 AM - Rex Anthony: It is a nice one. Bookmarked!
6/20/21, 8:38 AM - Rex Anthony: Sorry guys, couldn't make it yesterday. Looking forward to the next one
6/20/21, 10:19 AM - Williams: Good morning Fam
6/20/21, 10:20 AM - Bayo: Morning Wills
6/20/21, 10:21 AM - Williams: Can a color be applied to a navbar that already has an image from the background body
6/20/21, 10:22 AM - Bayo: Do you mean an overlay???
6/20/21, 10:22 AM - +234 814 135 2896: Morning boss
6/20/21, 10:25 AM - Williams: Yes
6/20/21, 10:26 AM - Williams: <Media omitted>
6/20/21, 10:29 AM - Bayo: You can use linear gradient
6/20/21, 10:29 AM - Bayo: Then target the navbar alone
6/20/21, 10:30 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Is your navbar and the logo in the same div?
6/20/21, 10:31 AM - Williams: Yes
6/20/21, 10:31 AM - Gold: No problem man, we missed you
6/20/21, 10:33 AM - Williams: But,still do not reflect
6/20/21, 10:34 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Set a background color of the div to any primary color so you can keep track of everything then set the class or id of the div to  position: fixed;
6/20/21, 10:35 AM - +234 812 077 2330: What does not reflect?
6/20/21, 10:36 AM - Williams: <Media omitted>
6/20/21, 10:36 AM - Williams: <Media omitted>
6/20/21, 10:37 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Try background-color
6/20/21, 10:38 AM - Williams: Still didn't show
6/20/21, 10:40 AM - Bayo: Give it a width and let's see
6/20/21, 10:41 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Your css file is linked properly to your html right? Try

 header .nav-bar{
background-color: red;
}
6/20/21, 10:45 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Is the z-index on the html styling necessary? I don't think so.
6/20/21, 10:46 AM - +234 812 077 2330: This might work too. 100% width.
6/20/21, 10:47 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Please share what you did when it works.
6/20/21, 10:48 AM - Williams: It did not
6/20/21, 10:48 AM - +234 812 077 2330: How about this?
6/20/21, 10:49 AM - +234 812 077 2330: And try commenting out the z-index: 10000 on the html styling.
6/20/21, 10:51 AM - +234 817 131 5756: 😲😲😲😲
6/20/21, 10:52 AM - Rex Anthony: z-index: 10000 is a little bit much
6/20/21, 10:53 AM - Williams: Okay
6/20/21, 10:53 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Yea I think so too, let's make it a comment so it doesn't affect the css and check
6/20/21, 11:00 AM - +234 812 077 2330: @2348067974694 you have put us on "problem solving" mode but you're not giving us speedy feedback. 😂
6/20/21, 11:00 AM - Segun: Your closing bracket for html should not be in the same line with .nav-bar
6/20/21, 11:01 AM - Segun: Lol, he's battling with it too
6/20/21, 11:01 AM - +234 812 077 2330: @2348067974694
6/20/21, 11:01 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Lol I guess so
6/20/21, 11:01 AM - Segun: Did you try this?
6/20/21, 11:02 AM - Segun: It should work
6/20/21, 11:07 AM - Bayo: Let's set it to display none and see if it's actually connected 

Cos uhmmm weird
6/20/21, 11:08 AM - Williams: I'm sorry oo

6/20/21, 11:15 AM - Bayo: Does it work??
6/20/21, 11:16 AM - Segun: Check if there's a mistake with colon and semi-colon somewhere, something is not right with that css. It's wierd.
6/20/21, 11:17 AM - Segun: It's no problem @2349034902480 next time.

6/20/21, 8:00 PM - +234 806 490 1390: How about you create a repo on github for the project and maybe add the bosses here as collaborators. I think that will help them get to look at the code better.

6/20/21, 8:11 PM - Bayo: That's means your css connection has an issue

6/21/21, 8:40 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Hey guys, I want create a relational database for an hospital.
I'm confused whether to create separate table and assign a role to them.
What do you think?
6/21/21, 8:41 PM - Emrys: This depends on the hospital's data
6/21/21, 8:42 PM - +234 909 603 5283: It's my final year project and I'm using my school health center as case study
6/21/21, 8:42 PM - Emrys: You need to get a sample data of your school's hospital
6/21/21, 8:42 PM - Emrys: Before you can model your database
6/21/21, 8:44 PM - Emrys: For example There can be a table named Patients which will have column name, age, dept, matric number, sex, type of sickness and etc
6/21/21, 8:45 PM - Emrys: There can also be a table named nurses which will contain all nurses in the center.
6/21/21, 8:47 PM - Emrys: A patient can be sick more than once so instead of type of sickness being under table patients It can be separate while there will be a sickness table which each of the sickness will have a one to many relationship  to patients and so on
6/21/21, 8:47 PM - Emrys: Get your sample data then we can help you with the model
6/21/21, 8:48 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Yeah. I plan to have separate tables for others too like diagnosis, appointments, etc
6/21/21, 8:49 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Thanks. I'll do that before this week ends

6/23/21, 10:27 AM - +31 6 87837364: Hi guys,

I just started to learn how to code. Started with HTML, now in CSS but it seems like the whole stuff is confusing me. Ah 🤦‍♂️

I need tips on how to overcome this confusion and phobia
6/23/21, 10:28 AM - +234 811 429 7496: LOL take it one day at a time bro
6/23/21, 10:31 AM - +31 6 87837364: I reduced the numbers of hours to 1 hour session per day in order not to choke myself. Yet, still not working for me
6/23/21, 10:31 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Lol I think the only way to beat the fear of code is writing code
6/23/21, 10:32 AM - +234 811 429 7496: are you learning on YouTube or freecodecamp
6/23/21, 10:36 AM - Eke: CSS can be tough when you're just starting out. But keep practicing, you'll get there. Tip: Don't try to memorize the properties, understand how it works and how to apply them instead. And ultimately; build lots and lots of simple projects.
6/23/21, 10:36 AM - Bayo: Hello everyone!

The last article I wrote on W3School spaces was acknowledged by their CEO and was recommended on their Official LinkedIn Account 😍

Now why should you consider using W3School spaces for your next static website? 🤷‍♂️

Find out from my newly published article below 👇

Wassup guys.

This project shows how to build a simple web dictionary.

Read up and build fellas
6/23/21, 10:22 PM - Emrys: Https://dict-demo.herokuapp.com

Here is the output
6/23/21, 10:26 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
6/23/21, 10:30 PM - +234 806 490 1390: But  I'm thinking what if you added onto the app the filter functionality such that on entry of a letter,  every word beginning with that letter that is in your database shows.  And then as the user types in the word every other unmatched term is removed.... 

I'm  just thinking
6/23/21, 10:31 PM - Emrys: That's another project
6/23/21, 10:32 PM - Emrys: Auto complete

6/24/21, 9:45 AM - +234 907 777 1659: A Quick question. For developers in this group who are self taught and do not have any university degree, are you planning to bag a university degree? Or do you feel you do not need it.
6/24/21, 9:49 AM - Segun: I don't think anyone needs it. It's just for credibility.
6/24/21, 9:50 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Honestly.......I plan to bag one in the nearest future
6/24/21, 9:51 AM - +27 68 266 9415: M a self teacher kkk and  experience matters to me alot than papers but it's good to have one..and especially some of us we do not have such kind of cash to enroll for degree.🤷‍♂️...
6/24/21, 9:51 AM - +234 806 490 1390: I have a background in psychology but I do frontend development now. 

Although I don't  think that's a compulsory requirement,  it may be booster though. 

I plan on doing a computer science related  degree soon enough  though.
6/24/21, 9:51 AM - +27 68 266 9415: But it's good to have one tho
6/24/21, 9:53 AM - +234 810 618 9445: Are there  courses that I can take, for credibility sake? Since I have a degree in something else that is totally unrelated.
6/24/21, 10:01 AM - Temi: Don't need it lol
6/24/21, 10:17 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Reason being that….most companies here or abroad requires cs degree or equivalent as most of their requirements for a tech role…..even for most internships sef😒😒
6/24/21, 10:18 AM - Temi: They do?
6/24/21, 10:20 AM - Temi: Maybe a few do. I wouldn’t say "most". Plus, I know successful tech guys without cs degrees

I think if its a thing that you can do, and have the time for, it's fine. I just don't think it's a necessity.

Or maybe I'm talking like this because I've already spent six plus years in school on one degree 😂
6/24/21, 10:22 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Most of those recruiters/hr ain’t a techie……so you might be surprised they make their judgment base on your degree
6/24/21, 10:23 AM - Temi: Oh that makes sense
6/24/21, 10:23 AM - +234 811 429 7496: I don't think this is correct
6/24/21, 10:25 AM - +234 703 983 1390: I studied fisheries technology and most of my rejection was based on that…..maybe I never met an understanding recruiter tho😂😂😂
6/24/21, 10:26 AM - +234 811 429 7496: but I also know a number of people working in tech that didn't even go to the university
6/24/21, 10:26 AM - +234 811 429 7496: I don't know man
6/24/21, 10:26 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Check indeed, LinkedIn, Workopolis, and the likes…..most of the requirements include having a cs degree or equivalent
6/24/21, 10:27 AM - +234 811 429 7496: I don't see the need for a degree tho if one can show your competence
6/24/21, 10:27 AM - +234 703 983 1390: I never go against that either
6/24/21, 10:28 AM - +234 703 983 1390: I was just talking about the job posting requirements
6/24/21, 10:29 AM - +234 703 983 1390: My current role doesn’t request for a degree either
6/24/21, 10:29 AM - +234 811 429 7496: that's true but you not need to meet all the requirements to apply
6/24/21, 10:29 AM - +234 811 429 7496: yes true
6/24/21, 10:32 AM - +234 703 983 1390: An instance…..if you’re only competent but doesn’t have a degree and other candidate is also competent and at the time has a degree.

You are both applying for the same role….Who has the upper hand among you?
6/24/21, 10:32 AM - +234 811 429 7496: lol the most competent
6/24/21, 10:33 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Both are most competent
6/24/21, 10:34 AM - +234 703 983 1390: But one has a degree and the other doesn’t have

You are the recruiter, what will your decision be based on?
6/24/21, 10:35 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Talking about a big company tho
6/24/21, 10:35 AM - +234 811 429 7496: i get how a degree can help in this scenario
6/24/21, 10:36 AM - +234 703 983 1390: That’s why if you have the opportunity to bag one…..why not for credibility sake?
6/24/21, 10:39 AM - Eke: If I could get it cool, but if I can't, no pressure. Not planning to have one for now though.
6/24/21, 10:39 AM - +234 811 429 7496: my problem is you don't learn any practical skill from studying  CS  in Nigeria
6/24/21, 10:40 AM - +234 811 429 7496: yeah exactly
6/24/21, 10:40 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Just an opinion tho…..I have seen a lot of recruiter that’s after your skills and competency and also gat some friends working in tech industry without a degree also
6/24/21, 10:40 AM - +234 811 429 7496: like person way study mechanical engineering foe 5 years and person way dey workshop dey learn work for 5 years
6/24/21, 10:40 AM - +234 811 429 7496: who sabi work pass lol
6/24/21, 10:41 AM - +234 703 983 1390: They one at the workshop learning obviously
6/24/21, 10:42 AM - +234 811 429 7496: I pray this becomes the norm
6/24/21, 10:43 AM - +234 703 983 1390: But in majority big companies…..who is always the boss?
The one who has a degree or the one who learn from workshop?
6/24/21, 10:53 AM - +234 703 983 1390: The one who has just degree without the skills will be bossing the one with skills without a degree….which is totally unfair😕😟

And the industry is becoming more and more competitive…I always preach having both the skills and the paper
6/24/21, 10:54 AM - +234 703 983 1390: I also don’t have any tho….so God help us without the degree 😎😎

6/25/21, 10:39 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I hope you're not in Nigeria.

6/27/21, 1:11 PM - +91 99968 05784: What do you prefer div tag or section tag in Html???
6/27/21, 1:13 PM - Temi: Section
6/27/21, 1:13 PM - +91 99968 05784: Why?
6/27/21, 1:13 PM - +234 810 618 9445: Section.
6/27/21, 1:18 PM - +234 812 077 2330: For the sake of writing standard semantic html, section tags are advised.
6/27/21, 1:19 PM - +234 817 131 5756: It depends. For a container inside another container no prefer divs. But for a section of a website I'll use section.
6/27/21, 1:22 PM - +91 99968 05784: ?
6/27/21, 1:35 PM - Gold: It's a public certificate (cryptography) which proves ownership of a public key
6/27/21, 1:35 PM - Gold: It just shows that the site the person is visiting is real and not a fake. Have you ever seen a padlock when you're browsing a website an SSL certificate gives that
6/27/21, 2:14 PM - +234 811 429 7496: 👍 thanks
6/27/21, 2:14 PM - Gold: Anytime brother

7/1/21, 12:33 AM - +234 809 379 2855: Write a function in this file called nine_lines that uses the function three_lines (provided below) to print a total of nine lines.

Now add a function named clear_screen that uses a combination of the functions nine_lines, three_lines, and new_line (provided below) to print a total of twenty-five lines. The last line of your program should call first nine_lines and then the clear_screen function.

The  function three_lines and new_line are defined below so that you can see nested function calls. Also, to make counting “blank” lines visually easier, the print command inside new_line will print a dot at the beginning of the line:

def new_line():

    print('.')

def three_lines():

    new_line()

    new_line()

If I'll change anything though, will put the about page content in a column since the about text is very long and squeezed into the right on desktop view. Aside from that, great project. 💯
7/1/21, 8:39 PM - +44 7398 105965: Thanks
7/1/21, 8:43 PM - +234 808 947 0944: Love it! It's smooth.

7/2/21, 11:15 AM - Eke: But I gotta say it's too close to the next users profile card and might be a bit confusing. I was thinking it would be better to be in the article tag

7/3/21, 10:38 AM - Gold: Do you like web development
7/3/21, 10:38 AM - Gold: In programming there's a lot of niches:
You can be an 
App Developer
Web developer
Machine Learning engineer
7/3/21, 10:38 AM - Gold: Data scientist
7/3/21, 10:39 AM - Gold: Block chain development
7/3/21, 10:39 AM - Gold: But web development is the most popular niche with the largest community
7/3/21, 10:39 AM - Gold: So what do you want
7/3/21, 10:39 AM - +234 816 771 0839: The one that people venture into
7/3/21, 10:40 AM - Gold: People venture into everything
7/3/21, 10:40 AM - Gold: But you want web development
7/3/21, 10:42 AM - +234 816 771 0839: Where do you think I should start from?
7/3/21, 10:44 AM - Gold: Every developers journey is different but since web development is what you've chosen
7/3/21, 10:44 AM - Gold: I agree with what the others up there have said
7/3/21, 10:45 AM - Gold: Start with HTML, then move in the CSS and then you can get into java Script
7/3/21, 10:45 AM - Gold: After that you can learn a front end framework like react
7/3/21, 10:45 AM - Gold: Or Angular
7/3/21, 10:46 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Please…..what’s HTML?
7/3/21, 10:46 AM - Gold: I'll send a voice note
7/3/21, 10:46 AM - +234 706 073 8426: Only if he chose to be a front end dev ... but if it's backend ... he can chose  node or another
7/3/21, 10:47 AM - +234 816 771 0839: Thanks
7/3/21, 10:46 AM - Gold: <Media omitted>

7/3/21, 10:48 AM - Gold: In web development they're two parts
7/3/21, 10:48 AM - Gold: Front end and back end
7/3/21, 10:48 AM - +234 706 073 8426: As a beginner... U don't need all this questions... U need to develop yourself first... make your research and know  what u are about to learn ..  U can Google or use YouTube... before u start asking
7/3/21, 10:49 AM - Gold: This is true Sha
7/3/21, 10:49 AM - Gold: You'll learn more when you learn on your own

7/3/21, 10:55 AM - Gold: Including how to set up your system to do web development
7/3/21, 10:55 AM - Gold: Yes😅
7/3/21, 10:56 AM - +234 703 983 1390: But…..coding is for brilliant people na😦
7/3/21, 10:56 AM - Eke: Highly recommended. Watch this video first if you wanna be a web dev
7/3/21, 10:56 AM - +234 703 983 1390: I ain’t brilliant at all
7/3/21, 11:02 AM - Williams: This js isn't making sense to me oo.The const and variable and other stuff how do I understand them.I mean how can de be applied?
7/3/21, 11:05 AM - +234 803 974 7164: They will be applied when you start working in the DOM when you start integrating js to html and css
7/3/21, 11:05 AM - Bayo: this article might help you 

https://unclebigbay.hashnode.dev/generations-of-javascript-variables
7/3/21, 11:05 AM - +234 812 077 2330: I agree with this. A lot of how you get better in web development has a lot to do with personal research. Knowing why you want to learn what you are going to be learning, knowing how to google, knowing how to practice as often as possible and KNOWING HOW TO LEARN in general. It may be scary to know this but the truth is, you might not have people available who can hold your hands throughout your learning. You will have to be comfortable with learning on your own 98% of the time. There are enough free resources online to get started.
7/3/21, 11:06 AM - +234 703 983 1390: <Media omitted>
7/3/21, 11:08 AM - +234 703 983 1390: It helped me while I was learning JavaScript…..it could be of help to you too🌚
7/3/21, 11:08 AM - Williams: Yea
7/3/21, 11:10 AM - Gold: Haha I'm not brilliant
7/3/21, 11:10 AM - +234 703 983 1390: And….it seems like you speaking in tongues to me now?😢
What is google and YouTube in relative to coding?
7/3/21, 11:10 AM - Gold: When you have problems
7/3/21, 11:10 AM - Gold: Or when you want to learn a new framework
7/3/21, 11:11 AM - Gold: Or library
7/3/21, 11:11 AM - Gold: You go in Google or YouTube learn it
7/3/21, 11:11 AM - +234 706 073 8426: If u don't know about Google and YouTube yet ... U have long way to go ...
7/3/21, 11:12 AM - Gold: He's starting just like we all did
7/3/21, 11:12 AM - Gold: He'll get there
7/3/21, 11:12 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Awwwnnnn 😢😢😢
7/3/21, 11:12 AM - Gold: Don't worry about it
7/3/21, 11:12 AM - Gold: This is how everyone started
7/3/21, 11:13 AM - Gold: I beleive you can do it
7/3/21, 11:13 AM - +234 706 073 8426: Even if u are starting some thing else ... that's not related to computing or programming... we all know u essence of Google in our day to day research
7/3/21, 11:14 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Thanks very much for believing in me tho @2347066985640 🌚

7/4/21, 4:59 PM - Bayo: depends on the project timeline(deadline) and what your client wants

7/4/21, 6:23 PM - Alegar: If you are learning try making yourself the front, it wont look as good as a template probably but you will understand a lot more.
7/4/21, 6:24 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I'll agree with Ale.G. it better you understand how a everything fits together than just making it work.
7/4/21, 7:46 PM - Eke: When you say template, do you mean using WordPress over hand coding?
7/5/21, 2:16 AM - Gold: Hey everyone
7/5/21, 2:17 AM - Gold: I wrote an article which shows you how to make use of the IBM Watson(@IBMWatson )Language Translation API to build AI which Translates  from one language to another and helps tell you the name of a language just by you giving it a sentence in the language. https://t.co/rvS4o1NP8v

7/5/21, 7:19 AM - +234 913 292 5682: Hey good morning everyone.
I don't how inappropriate what I'm doing right now is but I need to spread the word. This is my community, and a community is not only restricted to one niche or concentration.
People are sick guys, with terminal diseases, and most times we don't even know.... They never really tell us. I'm a product of being really really sick myself, no one ever knew or even suspected... So I know how people hide it... 
Healing stream's coming up and I'm so excited!
If you have loved ones or even a personal illness, you can participate. It's not limited to a religion, church or doctrine..... Everybody deserves to be healthy, so this is the link to join in and register https://healingstreams.tv/virtual/IBEIROM .....
It may not be you that's sick, you might not even know someone personally, but spread it!
Can you imagine how amazing it'll be when you eventually realize that you're somehow involved and connected to someone's healing.
Spread this good news guys. If you need more info on how to register and participate, you could just send a dm to me.... Thanks guys!!

7/5/21, 8:24 AM - Gold: You are right Iron, this was inappropriate this is a community of developers.

But I understand where you're coming and know you did it with good intentions from so there will be no punishment whatsoever.

But please when next you want to do something like this take permission from the admins

7/5/21, 10:26 AM - Gold: Hi everyone, I'm looking for a Kotlin developer to build a quick webview version of a website we have. We are planning on moving over from the react native world, but I have little native experience myself. 

Features:
- Back/forward buttons
- High priority App notifications (background, forground, with custom sound).
- Webview

Let me know how many hours this would take. Offering $15-25 usd/h depending on skill/eff.
Send me a msg here or david@lysterium.com

7/10/21, 8:52 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Quick one. What's y'all's opinion about WordPress? I've been getting different talks from people not to dive into it.
7/10/21, 8:56 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Good morning and welcome to everyone. Nice to meet you. I'm Ekes, a front-end web developer currently learning Javascript and WordPress
7/10/21, 8:58 AM - +234 907 777 1659: For me, being a developer without a niche seems incomplete. Wordpress is actually good and more than half of the internet is built with it. Having a Niche as a developer is really nice and WordPress happens to be a wonderful Niche. Other Niche could include: SalesForce, Shopify, E-Commerce and Blogs. However, WordPress is really wonderful.
7/10/21, 9:16 AM - +234 808 947 0944: I see Shopify a lot too. Thanks for the insight, Vive.

Are there resources you'd like to recommend or random videos on YouTube will do?
7/10/21, 9:17 AM - Segun: Fantastic. You said it all Iseoluwa.
7/10/21, 9:19 AM - Segun: Whether you choose HTML, CSS, JS or WordPress,  Shopify, Wix or other site builder, you are still a web developer.

Both have their market and they are both completely okay!
7/10/21, 9:19 AM - Segun: I have tried learning WordPress in the past and I love the experience.
7/10/21, 9:20 AM - +254 727 870371: I have some experience experience with WordPress, it's interesting to say
7/10/21, 9:21 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Thank you!
7/10/21, 9:21 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Really? Nice.
The feedback I got from a friend was not nice.
7/10/21, 9:21 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Wow, awesome!
7/10/21, 9:22 AM - +254 727 870371: But I didn't like it 😬😬😬.... But that's just me
7/10/21, 9:23 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Oops! 👀
7/10/21, 9:24 AM - +234 706 073 8426: As a freelancer... it's good to know both WordPress and coding 

Some projects will come .
. U don't need to stress yourself u just use wp  ... while some projects requires  coding from scratch... bcos wp is an open sourse
7/10/21, 9:24 AM - +254 727 870371: Yes.... Exactly
7/10/21, 9:24 AM - +254 727 870371: But I like a challenge
7/10/21, 9:24 AM - Segun: Was he using it? And for how many years? You need to consider that too.

Try watch a crash course on it.
7/10/21, 9:25 AM - Segun: Perfect! If you want to freelance. WordPress, Shopify is the fastest way to go 🚀🚀
7/10/21, 9:27 AM - +234 706 073 8426: Yea but if you want real job that pays ... better learn coding ... tho it's not easy
7/10/21, 9:28 AM - +234 808 947 0944: He just said he's tried it in the past and he didn't like it. Told me it's not the "best practice". 
I'll probably just watch a crash course like you said.
7/10/21, 9:28 AM - +234 808 947 0944: I'd like to freelance sha. Never tried any of those two.
7/10/21, 9:29 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Same. As long as it doesn't threating my mental health.
7/10/21, 9:36 AM - Segun: Find out yourself, you might find it as 'your' best practice.
7/10/21, 9:36 AM - Segun: 💯
7/10/21, 9:45 AM - +234 808 947 0944: Thank you for this! 
I'd give a feedback once I give it a try.

Question. 

Why is PowerShell not as popular as bash? 

PowerShell seems superior when developing on a Windows machine.
7/11/21, 4:39 PM - Gold: Most of the work we do as devs is done on custom CLIs
7/11/21, 4:39 PM - Gold: Like git is done in git bash
7/11/21, 4:39 PM - Gold: Node on the node cli
7/11/21, 4:39 PM - Gold: And also if you use the conda package you have conda so
7/11/21, 4:40 PM - Gold: That's it besides PowerShell is ugly
7/11/21, 4:40 PM - Gold: All blue😅
7/11/21, 4:40 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: I agree on the ugly.
7/11/21, 4:40 PM - Emrys: It can also be done on powershell
7/11/21, 4:40 PM - Emrys: If they are done on the windows powershell
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: Personally I use the conda and node CLIs
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: They're more intuitive
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: And traditional
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Emrys: Linked to windows environmental variables
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: For me
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: My experience was, PowerShell was easier to learn.
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Emrys: Powershell commands are long
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: All CLIs are
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Emrys: To copy you need to type copy but Linux you just cp
7/11/21, 4:41 PM - Gold: <Media omitted>
7/11/21, 4:43 PM - Emrys: I use git bash on all my ides.
7/11/21, 4:43 PM - Emrys: The tools are much that's why
7/11/21, 4:43 PM - +234 703 653 5792: This message was deleted
7/11/21, 4:44 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: I am just confused. Because I can access node from PowerShell. GitHub CLI from PowerShell. WinGet CLI from PowerShell. Git from PowerShell. Start servers. The list goes on. It feels like PowerShell can do everything bash can. So I was just wondering.
7/11/21, 4:45 PM - Emrys: Thats because they linked themselves to system environmental variable path
7/11/21, 4:45 PM - Emrys: If they don't you'll have to do that yourself
7/11/21, 4:45 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: Ohhhh

7/11/21, 5:16 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Hi everyone... Trust we are doing fine..

So I started React this week, I noticed it takes so long to get the server running when I enter npm start.

Is that always the case? Is React slow to startup?
7/11/21, 5:24 PM - +254 727 870371: This is usually an option u can choose during git installation,
7/11/21, 5:24 PM - +254 727 870371: Me too
7/11/21, 5:48 PM - +234 808 947 0944: I experience the same. Sometimes, it could be faster.

But how long does yours take though?
7/11/21, 5:53 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Oh okay... I'm a bit relieved

Mine takes between 3 - 5 mins
7/11/21, 5:56 PM - +234 814 414 9628: VueJs and other languages takes seconds to start...

I want to believe there's an issue here
7/11/21, 5:58 PM - +234 808 947 0944: Oh, mine takes about 2 - 4 mins I think. I varies.
7/11/21, 5:58 PM - +234 808 947 0944: Really? I've not tried those other guys yet.
7/11/21, 5:59 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Yeah.. To run django or flask server doesn't take time at all..

Very fast
7/11/21, 5:59 PM - +234 814 414 9628: VueJs too
7/11/21, 6:02 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Normal react app should be up and running within 1 min. It's when you add things, like tailwindcss that it I'll take more time
7/11/21, 6:03 PM - Gold: Usually
7/11/21, 6:04 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay.. What I did was I used create-react-app to create a new app. Then I did npm start and it was slow.

Do other libraries come together with a new react app that makes it slow?
7/11/21, 6:05 PM - +234 808 947 0944: Which do you prefer between React and Vuejs?
7/11/21, 6:05 PM - +234 808 947 0944: I don't even use tailwind.
7/11/21, 6:07 PM - +234 814 414 9628: That's what I'm about to find out..

I've used VueJs for like 2 yrs now but there are more React jobs out there than Vue.. 

So.. I'm about to find out just how good React is
7/11/21, 6:07 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Yes, other libraries are pre-installed. But im not sure if they are the cause
7/11/21, 6:08 PM - +234 808 947 0944: Nice. I'm only just trying to be comfortable with react myself, I'm new to it.
7/11/21, 6:09 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Cool.. Maybe we can learn together 🙌🏻
7/11/21, 6:10 PM - +234 909 603 5283: I'll recommend the react free course on scrimba for you guys
7/11/21, 6:10 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay... Maybe its npm?

I saw on reddit.. Someone suggested using yarn instead.. I don't know
7/11/21, 6:10 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Please share the link thank you 🙏
7/11/21, 6:11 PM - +234 909 603 5283: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact
7/11/21, 6:13 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Though, I recently started using yarn. I can say if there's was a difference. I might not have noticed it
7/11/21, 6:13 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Wow.. About 59 course materials!

Cool! 🤜🤛
7/11/21, 6:15 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay... I'll just continue. Maybe it will become faster as I go on.

Thanks for sharing that course 🙏
7/11/21, 6:16 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Y'all welcome
7/11/21, 6:16 PM - +234 808 947 0944: I'd like that.

7/12/21, 6:14 AM - +254 727 870371: I remember this lecturer used to teach us Java Code using slides. Imagine someone expecting you to learning by looking at projected code.
7/12/21, 6:53 AM - Alegar: Dude but i will agree om something, you don't make money with what they teach you at college.

And even online courses won't give you money, that you earn it on the job working, and those skills you also learn then at the job. Most of the time.

7/12/21, 3:03 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Hello everyone!

I'm  currently building my personal website using html and css and a little javascript. 
I'm wondering how to implement SEO on the site. 

Many tutorials point to using SEOs on Wordpress sites. I have yet to come across any for pure html,  css sites. 

Can someone help me out please??
7/12/21, 3:16 PM - +91 99968 05784: Use meta tag with discription
7/12/21, 3:17 PM - +91 99968 05784: Title tag is too much important use it carefully
7/12/21, 3:17 PM - +91 99968 05784: Use these tags 
Header 
footer 
article
 main 
nav 
aside
 section
7/12/21, 3:18 PM - +91 99968 05784: Use heading carefully
7/12/21, 3:18 PM - +91 99968 05784: Use only one h1 tag in your page
7/12/21, 3:19 PM - +91 99968 05784: Make it easy for the user to interact with your website this will help too
7/12/21, 3:22 PM - +91 99968 05784: Using the right keyword at the right place will help too

Like if you want to add more about you just use the keyword "about"

Because i have seen some websites that uses something like "wanna know me tap me" 😂
7/12/21, 3:23 PM - +91 99968 05784: Using backlinks can help too i think i am not confirmed on this
7/12/21, 3:24 PM - +91 99968 05784: Make your code clean and simple will help too
7/12/21, 3:26 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Thanks @919996805784

7/12/21, 3:40 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Does this mean I wouldn't  need an SEO service ? Like google site kit,  yoast etc?
7/12/21, 3:40 PM - +91 99968 05784: I donot know abt it
7/12/21, 3:40 PM - +91 99968 05784: What is it?

Click the properties then it'll take you to a network settings menu, choose *change adapter settings* you'll see the WiFi network, right-click you'll see password and a checkbox to toggle it on.

7/13/21, 3:13 PM - Emrys: The url brought out the repo
7/13/21, 3:30 PM - Eke: It brought out the repo he pasted, might not be the correct one. But that's not the point. It is if his remote command was correct because a simple typo on the URL or on the git command can cause this.

Have you ever been in the midst of other programmers, possibly at a tech meetup, a tutorial class, an online forum, or anywhere else and you keep hearing some terms you are not familiar with but you don't want to look like a complete novice so you don't ask questions and just nod along?

Yeah, every programmer at some point in their career must have found themselves in such a scenario.

The article below considers 10 terminologies a python programmer should know and use when having conversations with his pairs.

7/14/21, 10:55 AM - Williams: Good morning FAM.. Can someone help me understand what a return statement is and it's function
7/14/21, 11:25 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Hello bro.. 

A return statement ends the execution of a function.

This means that when a function is called, all the codes in the function runs up to the point where it gets to a return statement. If there should be a code after the return statement in a function, that code will not run.

The interpreter sees a return statement as the end of a function
7/14/21, 11:29 AM - +234 814 414 9628: In Python,

If I have a function named shout as shown below:

def shout:
    print('yay')
    return 'yay'
    

This will print out 'yay' two times when the function is called but if the function called was written as:

def shout:
    return 'yay'
    print('yay')

This will print as 'yay' just once.

I hope this is helpful
7/14/21, 12:24 PM - +90 531 937 83 05 left
7/14/21, 12:58 PM - Emrys: It is used to return a value from a function or method.

In some languages it can be used without a value to return in that case to exit a function of method for example javascript

divide = (x, y)=>{
  if (y==0){
     console.log("Can't divide by Zero")
     return
   }
  console.log(x/y)
}

The divide function here will execute the if statement if the y is 0 and just exits the function without calling console.log(x/y).

The above divide method can also be written in if else statements such as

divide = (x, y)=>{
  if (y==0){
     console.log("Can't divide by Zero")
   }else{
  console.log(x/y)
  }
}

The two methods above only prints it out but what if you are writing a math program that follows bodmas rules and you need to divide first then call addition function with the value from the divide

divide = (x, y)=>{
  if (y==0){
     console.log("Can't divide by Zero")
     return
   }
  return x/y
}

This function above can now be accessed as 
value = divide(4, 2)
Where value will be a variable holding the value of the division which you can pass as parameter to another function.

If the first two functions above not containing the return x/y  are called like value = divide(4, 2), the value will hold nothing as they returned nothing.

So return lets you get the value returned from a function and save it in a variable or perform any operation on it.

7/15/21, 10:59 AM - +234 806 490 1390: Good morning y'all. 

I'm doing a little project that requires me to use a *select tag*. When I click the select tag a drop down of *option tags* are revealed and on selecting any of the options tag, I want it to fire an event that dynamically populates the DOM with content from JavaScript.

Now I have tried using the *click event*. But I noticed it isn't working. I have also checked the console to see if there are any error flags but I've seen none.

Can someone please help out with this please?

Thanks.

Started a week ago.
7/16/21, 9:35 AM - +234 803 643 9441: Nothing*
7/16/21, 9:37 AM - +233 55 806 1770: Having a separate twitter and ig page for web dev has been very helpful to me because when i log in, everything i see is like a revision or a new knowledge to keep. It will help you to develop faster .
7/16/21, 9:38 AM - +233 55 806 1770: You can also google for some projects relating to HTML and CSS, that's also cool.
7/16/21, 9:39 AM - +234 803 643 9441: Thank you
7/16/21, 9:39 AM - +234 803 643 9441: Gonna check it out

7/16/21, 10:59 AM - +234 812 073 4527: ☝🏽
7/16/21, 11:00 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Bugs up for taking the first step. Smart grinding gets the job done.
7/16/21, 11:01 AM - +234 812 073 4527: Check fronendmentor.io and other css battle website
7/16/21, 11:04 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I have a project I'm currently working on, a Weather App. But I've got issues bring in the API results from OpenWeatherMap.
Here's  the link to the repo: https://github.com/pablo-clueless/Weather-App.
Don't mind the ugliness, but I like to get functionality first before style.
7/16/21, 11:12 AM - +263 77 291 9712: On it
7/16/21, 11:21 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Please what is the best road map for someone to use to learn fe dev
7/16/21, 11:21 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Thanks a lot.
7/16/21, 11:22 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Alot of resources I'm getting confused
7/16/21, 11:22 AM - +234 902 396 6260: HTML5, CSS3, JS, in that order.
7/16/21, 11:22 AM - +234 808 809 0573: Hi, I'm Cornell from Nigeria.
FE dev.
7/16/21, 11:23 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Yes
7/16/21, 11:23 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I recommend freeCodeCamp and Traversy Media on YouTube and docs from W3Schools and MDN.
7/16/21, 11:23 AM - +234 808 809 0573: I know PHP.
7/16/21, 11:23 AM - +27 68 266 9415: tru
7/16/21, 11:23 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Hmm. Alright. Just registered on freecodecamp
7/16/21, 11:24 AM - +27 68 266 9415: w3schools got resources that i understand
7/16/21, 11:24 AM - +234 909 602 6989: OK thank you
7/16/21, 11:30 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Please the keys in the API only allow 100 search/day. If you're helping me with this, places kindly reduce your refresh rate. Thanks a lot.
7/16/21, 11:32 AM - Emmanuel: https://roadmap.sh/frontend
7/16/21, 11:35 AM - +233 55 806 1770: Traversy Media is a lifesaver. Watch their videos before you start the language. Gives you an overview of what you are about to do.
7/16/21, 11:35 AM - +233 55 806 1770: It helps you to understand the stuff way faster.
7/16/21, 11:36 AM - +234 812 073 4527: I'm Idris from Nigeria
7/16/21, 11:43 AM - +234 902 396 6260: You know ball. Brad is like super saiyan in  programming.
7/16/21, 11:59 AM - +232 99 783218: Check roadmap.sh for complete and great guide
7/16/21, 12:10 PM - +232 99 783218: I would suggest u start using *fetch API* instead.

Its more simple and easy to use
7/16/21, 12:12 PM - +234 909 602 6989: Thank you
7/16/21, 12:17 PM - +234 902 396 6260: That's the first thing I did, it switched to XMLHttpRequest when Fetch didn't work.
7/16/21, 12:19 PM - +232 99 783218: hmmmm, ok.
7/16/21, 12:43 PM - +91 99994 11498 left

7/16/21, 5:56 PM - +234 803 643 9441: What's the difference between HTML5 and XHTML?
7/16/21, 5:58 PM - +263 77 291 9712: XHTML is a combination of HTML and XML, whereas HTML5 is a version of HTML
7/16/21, 5:59 PM - +234 803 643 9441: So they aren't the same thing ?
7/16/21, 5:59 PM - +263 77 291 9712: different but somehow the same
7/16/21, 6:00 PM - +263 77 291 9712: main difference is the strictness in writing the code
7/16/21, 6:00 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Oh thank you
7/16/21, 6:00 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Can you give me an advise as a newbie?
7/16/21, 6:01 PM - +263 77 291 9712: if u are a newbie
7/16/21, 6:01 PM - +263 77 291 9712: stat
7/16/21, 6:02 PM - +263 77 291 9712: follow this order
7/16/21, 6:02 PM - +263 77 291 9712: 1. learn html
7/16/21, 6:02 PM - +263 77 291 9712: 2. learn css
7/16/21, 6:02 PM - +263 77 291 9712: 3. learn php
7/16/21, 6:03 PM - +263 77 291 9712: 4. learn java script
7/16/21, 6:03 PM - +263 77 291 9712: make projects, the more u get better the more u start appreciating things like xml
7/16/21, 6:04 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @263772919712 How about JS before PHP??
7/16/21, 6:04 PM - +234 807 859 1688: What about JavaScript
7/16/21, 6:04 PM - +263 77 291 9712: dont skip any stage and dont compare ypurself to what others are doing or at what level they at
7/16/21, 6:04 PM - +263 77 291 9712: because u will end up mixing staff and get confused
7/16/21, 6:05 PM - +263 77 291 9712: I want him/her to learn how to make a simple basic website before he can make web apps or make the site dinamic
7/16/21, 6:05 PM - +263 77 291 9712: after he/she masters simple html,css,php then he/she can waste a lot of time writing code and understanding javascript
7/16/21, 6:06 PM - +263 77 291 9712: i almost left web dev when i mixed learn css and javascript at the same time
7/16/21, 6:07 PM - +263 77 291 9712: learning*
7/16/21, 6:08 PM - +232 99 783218: Why PHP before JavaScript🤔🤔🤔
7/16/21, 6:09 PM - +263 77 291 9712: mixup
7/16/21, 6:10 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤔🤔🤔I don't think so.

but everything depends on his brain, time and effort
7/16/21, 6:10 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Which one you learn first is up to you, learning one will make learning the other much easier.
7/16/21, 6:10 PM - +263 77 291 9712: But first learn HTML followed by CSS. With those two you are good to go as a web dev
7/16/21, 6:11 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Javascript, php, databases etc are more of add on skills to make a dynamic or to increase functionality to your site
7/16/21, 6:11 PM - +263 77 291 9712: so whatever your learn after HTML and CSS is solely up to you, depending on what you want your site to do
7/16/21, 6:13 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Thank you @263772919712
7/16/21, 6:14 PM - +234 701 882 5886: 👌👌👌
7/16/21, 6:15 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 😂😂😂
Very understandable.
7/16/21, 6:16 PM - +263 77 291 9712: and this is true, your commitment is all that matters. how i learnt was more like cheating, i would download css templates online and then start editing them until they became what i wanted. yes now i have decent web dev skills but i cheated. so to make the journey simple for you, practice html and css everyday for like at least two hours a day for 10 days straight. focus on the two alone and nothing more or less until u can create a decent looking simple site (web pages) without any help. then after start start these javascript php etc thingies. @23299783218 said it correct, what makes one a good code writer is time, the more u write code the better u become
7/16/21, 6:17 PM - +263 77 291 9712: 😂😂😂
7/16/21, 6:18 PM - +263 77 291 9712: You are welcome
7/16/21, 6:19 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @2348036439441 Do not attempt to use any frameworks or preprocessors yet. You might start hearing of Pug, Haml, Bootstrap, Tailwind etc. Avoid them until you can make at least a landing page using pure HTML and CSS.
7/16/21, 6:20 PM - +263 77 291 9712: exactly, for now start with html then add css and focus on those two only
7/16/21, 6:20 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I think i can make at least a landing page
7/16/21, 6:20 PM - +232 99 783218: @2348036439441 don't bother trying to use a framework especially CSS frameworks.

when u learn CSS indepth you would only use frameworks to speed up development.
7/16/21, 6:21 PM - +234 803 643 9441: The problem here I'm still learning those languages. My laptop got spoilt yesterday
7/16/21, 6:21 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I want to cry 💔
7/16/21, 6:22 PM - +232 99 783218: I would suggest doing lot of practice and building anything that comes to your mind but do it with the skills you know.

that way u can see what you need to learn more and what u need to improve on
7/16/21, 6:22 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Bravo. I love this 
Thank you sparrow. I believe I'll get there
7/16/21, 6:22 PM - +232 99 783218: Oooh sorry about that.
you can still practice using coding apps or even code editors for mobile.
7/16/21, 6:23 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Not going to be as effective as using the laptop
7/16/21, 6:23 PM - +232 99 783218: Learn a concept then build something around it.

Do that until you know the concept better, then move on to the next concept.
7/16/21, 6:24 PM - +232 99 783218: true but you will also appreciate how to write and read dry code.

It's hard and painful but it will help you read code a lot easier
7/16/21, 6:25 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Can i kindly get a coding app ?
7/16/21, 6:25 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Thanks sparrow.
7/16/21, 6:26 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Try TrebEdit for Android. It's like atom for mobile.
7/16/21, 6:26 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @23299783218 is really dropping some great advice. Big ups man.
7/16/21, 6:28 PM - +232 99 783218: Sololearn is one of the best for me.

Its like Facebook for programmers
7/16/21, 6:28 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝I have gone through the pain bro.😹🤣🤣

I don't want anyone else to go through it again
7/16/21, 6:30 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I'll check it too
7/16/21, 6:30 PM - +232 99 783218: I started coding with my phone (2017) and it was extremely hard and painful and the keyboard was terrible😢😢

I never had a computer until 2019.

So I never learned much until 2020 and I got serious this year😹🤣🤣
7/16/21, 6:30 PM - +234 803 643 9441: That's a long way bro
7/16/21, 6:31 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I started coding last week
Got good at with HTML within days now I'm learning both HTML and CSS
7/16/21, 6:33 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Same but I started late 2019. I had a laptop o used for video editing and live streaming, it got broken when I started learning web dev. I used my phone throughout 2020 too. It's very crazy, sometimes the code don't work like they should, dev tools. Hard grind it was.
7/16/21, 6:33 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Do you use the semantics or everything is a div??
7/16/21, 6:34 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I haven't built anything yet. I just pratice whatever i learn everyday
7/16/21, 6:35 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool, HTML is easy to learn, but many more tricks you will see later as you go
7/16/21, 6:59 PM - +91 80721 57649 left
7/16/21, 6:35 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I believe so. I find it easy
7/16/21, 6:35 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹🤣I still can't find a way to debug my code on phone.
7/16/21, 6:36 PM - +232 99 783218: try building a small project.

maybe a navigation would be nice to start with
7/16/21, 6:37 PM - +91 85400 64287: Is PHP necessary to learn? What is it used for ?
7/16/21, 6:37 PM - +232 99 783218: or a list of favorite things or something just in plain HTML
7/16/21, 6:38 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Debug on phone?? If I find anyone who could do that, the person is probably building a time machine in their backyard.
7/16/21, 6:38 PM - +232 99 783218: Mostly backend.
It is still used, but people are moving away from it slowly.

It powers more than 60% of the web,
7/16/21, 6:38 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹😹its crazy, almost impossible
7/16/21, 6:39 PM - +91 85400 64287: Ohhh which languages can replace it?
7/16/21, 6:39 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Yup, I'm planning to go Python by the beginning of next year.
7/16/21, 6:40 PM - +234 902 396 6260: NodeJs, Python, Ruby, GoLang, Java, C.
7/16/21, 6:40 PM - +234 902 396 6260: And more people are moving to Python by the way.
7/16/21, 6:41 PM - +263 77 291 9712: stick to these two for another week or so. sorry about your laptop but u can use your mobile device until u get a replacement
7/16/21, 6:43 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @2348036439441 One more thing and it has helped me a lot. Whenever you want to build something, try "drawing" it down. The layouts, buttons, images, every components. It helps keep your on track sort of and you don't go trying to squeeze in every bit of "fun and amazing stuffs" you see.
7/16/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: Python
Java
Golang
JavaScript
C# 

almost all other major language can replace it.
7/16/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: the best ones will be 
Java
JavaScript
Python

Golang is coming slowly
7/16/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: I started it, learned the basics, then i switched to frontend
7/16/21, 6:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Everyone almost always start with Python.
7/16/21, 6:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I find the syntax easy to read and understand than the devil's handwriting called JS.
7/16/21, 6:48 PM - +263 77 291 9712: and if things remain like this i think in 5 to 10 years pyhton will be bigger than any C language or java
7/16/21, 6:48 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹🤣🤣🤣he wont be able once he becomes comfortable with CSS.

Its extremely tempting to add cool things
7/16/21, 6:49 PM - Emrys: Nope
7/16/21, 6:50 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 😂😂😂
True.
7/16/21, 6:50 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹when I started JS i avoided it, then after a few months I came back because I realized I cant avoid it.

I struggled with the DOM a whole month and some weeks.

then everything became super cool and easy
7/16/21, 6:52 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you begin to make things happen in DOM without "using", then you get drawn in.
7/16/21, 6:53 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Let me get there 😂
7/16/21, 6:53 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, 🤣😹😹

Now I switched to frameworks, learning and using Svelte for now
7/16/21, 6:53 PM - +232 99 783218: but Golang is on the rise too and Web Assembly too is gaining speed
7/16/21, 6:53 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I want react.
7/16/21, 6:55 PM - +232 99 783218: I don't like react.

i prefer Vue and Svelte.
7/16/21, 6:56 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Why?? JSX??
7/16/21, 6:58 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah JSX is one.
and I try to read some code from their documentation, i almost cried😢
7/16/21, 6:58 PM - +232 99 783218: Vue JS was my first option, but I heard of Svelte and decide to try it. Now I'm stuck🤣😹😹

I even see Vue as a hard framework to learn
7/16/21, 6:59 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Reason I haven't started is I'm trying to digest the docs.
7/16/21, 6:59 PM - +234 701 882 5886: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 6:59 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'll look up Svelte but then if I don't React, I'll rather go for Vue.
7/16/21, 7:00 PM - +234 902 396 6260: JS is the Adamic Language itself, written by the gods.
7/16/21, 7:00 PM - Emrys: C the eldest
7/16/21, 7:01 PM - Emrys: If there is complaint in js like this, if you now program in c nko
7/16/21, 7:01 PM - +232 99 783218: Oooh, I think you should start.

Don't make the mistake of learning JavaScript so much before starting a framework.

I made that with Java and I almost died
7/16/21, 7:04 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Wow!! You're a pro in this game. That's exactly what I'm trying to do. I feel I need to be able to do a lot in JS before learning a framework.
7/16/21, 7:06 PM - +232 99 783218: nope, Java learn me a lot of lesson.

I took a whole year and some months learning just the basics of Java🤣😹😹 and I still couldn't master it
7/16/21, 7:06 PM - +232 99 783218: I'm not a pro yet. because I wasted a lot of time learning just the basics and pushing myself backwards.
7/16/21, 7:07 PM - +232 99 783218: Just learn the basics of JavaScript and try to really understand the DOM.

Switch to using a framework, then u can learn the rest as u go along
7/16/21, 7:08 PM - +232 99 783218: I can't even use some features of ES6 loops (filters, map and reduce) but I can still do all those with the basic knowledge.

except that they make things easier and write less code
7/16/21, 7:11 PM - +234 701 882 5886: Y’all chill please 

For the last time, after HTML and CSS what’s next😩😩🥺
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - +234 701 882 5886: JS or PHP
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - Emrys: Do you know the reason?
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I actually most of the ES6 syntax easy to understand; string literal, ternary operator, arrow functions, map.
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - +91 85400 64287: Is java and javascript related?
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - Emrys: Why it took you so long?
7/16/21, 7:12 PM - Emrys: Nope
7/16/21, 7:13 PM - Emrys: Java is a programming language while js is a scripting language
7/16/21, 7:13 PM - +91 85400 64287: Then why he saying java in javascript discussion?
7/16/21, 7:13 PM - +234 902 396 6260: You choose your poison.
7/16/21, 7:13 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Elucidate of you know please.
7/16/21, 7:13 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Not remotely.
7/16/21, 7:14 PM - +234 902 396 6260: He was making a reference to another language.
7/16/21, 7:14 PM - Emrys: Because you focused on learning the language and not learning programming itself
7/16/21, 7:14 PM - +91 85400 64287: Okk
7/16/21, 7:14 PM - Emrys: You kept on learning the language instead of working on mini projects
7/16/21, 7:15 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 🤔
7/16/21, 7:15 PM - +91 85400 64287: Is python also a scripting lang?
7/16/21, 7:15 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nice explanation.
7/16/21, 7:15 PM - Emrys: Nope
7/16/21, 7:16 PM - Emrys: Python is a programming language that is interpreted
7/16/21, 7:16 PM - +91 85400 64287: What is scriptinh albg then?
7/16/21, 7:16 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nope, it's a programming language.
7/16/21, 7:16 PM - +91 85400 64287: *scripting lang
7/16/21, 7:16 PM - Emrys: But can be used for scripting
7/16/21, 7:17 PM - +234 909 602 6989: What's a scripting Lang and how's it different from a programming language?
7/16/21, 7:17 PM - +234 902 396 6260: It's a runtime that automates actions that otherwise who need a human operator.
7/16/21, 7:18 PM - +91 85400 64287: Python also does the same thing no?
7/16/21, 7:18 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nope.
7/16/21, 7:18 PM - +91 85400 64287: That famous book "automate the boring stuff with python"
7/16/21, 7:18 PM - Emrys: Scripting language needs to be hosted
7/16/21, 7:19 PM - Emrys: Programming language is independent
7/16/21, 7:19 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Python is compiled and creates executable while JS is interpreted.
7/16/21, 7:19 PM - +91 85400 64287: No python is not compiled, it's also interpreted
7/16/21, 7:20 PM - Emrys: This means as electronics raspberry pi, Arduino can run python without any need of dependency on another language js cant be run
7/16/21, 7:20 PM - +91 85400 64287: Compiled lang are C, C++, java
7/16/21, 7:20 PM - Emrys: Python is interpreted
7/16/21, 7:20 PM - Emrys: Java is compiled and interpreted
7/16/21, 7:21 PM - +91 85400 64287: Ohh ok, don't know that
7/16/21, 7:21 PM - +263 77 291 9712: The compilation happens behind the scene
7/16/21, 7:21 PM - +263 77 291 9712: lol
7/16/21, 7:21 PM - Emrys: Python is never compiled it is interpreted
7/16/21, 7:22 PM - +91 85400 64287: Then in every lang it happens behind the scenes
7/16/21, 7:22 PM - +91 90823 40547: Hello everyone I'm beginner in web development
I've learnt HTML CSS 
Should I learn bootstrap or JS ?
7/16/21, 7:22 PM - Emrys: Java is first compiled to bytecode then the bytecode is interpreted
7/16/21, 7:23 PM - +263 77 291 9712: CPython, the most widely used python language is both compiled and interpreted
7/16/21, 7:23 PM - +263 77 291 9712: I'm sure you know this already
7/16/21, 7:23 PM - +91 85400 64287: Ok thanks
7/16/21, 7:23 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Most python compilation is done behind the scenes
7/16/21, 7:24 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Proof for Python compilation is when you import any Python module in another program. In the imported module directory, another file with the same name .pyc will generate. This file executes later on.
7/16/21, 7:24 PM - Emrys: Cpython is an extension of c in python style
7/16/21, 7:24 PM - +232 99 783218: I suggest trying both, they see which one u like more.

But mind you, 
JavaScript is for frontend 
PHP is for backed

JavaScript can also be used in the backend
7/16/21, 7:24 PM - Emrys: If python was compiled then it would be generating an executable
7/16/21, 7:25 PM - +263 77 291 9712: yes, and CPython takes the responsibility of both compilation and interpretation.
7/16/21, 7:25 PM - Emrys: Java generates
C generates
C++ does 

But python doesn't
7/16/21, 7:25 PM - +232 99 783218: because I was not really over killing my self to master everything and the more I learn, the more I see new things. And eventually it got boring
7/16/21, 7:25 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Python is a “COMPILED INTERPRETED” language.
7/16/21, 7:26 PM - +232 99 783218: Nope,
7/16/21, 7:26 PM - +263 77 291 9712: This means when the Python program is run,

1. First Python checks for program syntax
2. Compiles and converts it to bytecode, and directly bytecode is loaded in system memory.
3. Then compiled bytecode interpreted from memory to execute it.
Whereas other languages like c convert programs to machine code and save them as executables in the disk. And then the user can run it as a.out
7/16/21, 7:26 PM - +232 99 783218: because I didn't the same mistake when I was learning Java.

Now I did make that mistake in Javascript
7/16/21, 7:27 PM - Emrys: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 7:27 PM - +232 99 783218: Yep, but technically all of them are also programming languages🤣😹😹
7/16/21, 7:27 PM - +263 77 291 9712: So, like i said, the compilation of python is done I wrote this for my thesis when doing my masters in software engineering
7/16/21, 7:28 PM - +232 99 783218: Python is interpreted
7/16/21, 7:29 PM - Emrys: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 7:29 PM - +232 99 783218: Try bootstrap and see if you like it.

But anything bootstrap can do, you can also do it with CSS and less code too
7/16/21, 7:29 PM - +263 77 291 9712: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 7:30 PM - +263 77 291 9712: This is Python, i wrote a thesis on this for my masters. google will fool u into believing a lot of things
7/16/21, 7:31 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Because most google answers contradict
7/16/21, 7:31 PM - +232 99 783218: nope, Python is only interpreted, it reads the code line by line during runtime
7/16/21, 7:32 PM - +91 77050 11973 left
7/16/21, 7:32 PM - +232 99 783218: I mostly use the official site to know about a language, they are the best
7/16/21, 7:32 PM - +263 77 291 9712: on the human eye it is interpreted i agree, what about behind the scenes. thats why i gave an example of CPYTHON. Python is a Compiled Interpreted language
7/16/21, 7:32 PM - +263 77 291 9712: exactly, and what does it say about CPython
7/16/21, 7:33 PM - +232 99 783218: for behind the scenes, all languages eventually gets compiled😁
7/16/21, 7:33 PM - +234 701 882 5886: How about HTML CSS and a framework then PHP for backend
7/16/21, 7:33 PM - +234 913 292 5682: With all this grammar I'm seeing
You people have pursurd someone😂
7/16/21, 7:34 PM - Emrys: Python was written in c
7/16/21, 7:34 PM - +263 77 291 9712: lol, thats why Python is growing slowly to become the biggest language
7/16/21, 7:35 PM - +232 99 783218: yep, it works too.

You only need HTML to build a website.

The rest are just additional for styling and functionality
7/16/21, 7:37 PM - +234 701 882 5886: Thanks boss
7/16/21, 7:38 PM - +91 90823 40547: Would it be better to learn bootstrap?
7/16/21, 7:38 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝no worries
7/16/21, 7:38 PM - +232 99 783218: personally yes and no
7/16/21, 7:39 PM - +91 90823 40547: Okay thanks alot
7/16/21, 7:39 PM - Emrys: You have to have a sense of how what you want to learn works
7/16/21, 7:39 PM - +232 99 783218: Yes, because you would want a fast development in future and to see how frameworks work.

No because you can build everything and even tweak it how you want
7/16/21, 7:40 PM - Emrys: They have limits to Thier tweaks
7/16/21, 7:41 PM - Emrys: Then you have to consider data usage why download the whole code when you just want to use a feature that you should write yourself
7/16/21, 7:42 PM - +91 90823 40547: I am not a computer science student. I am learning all this with my own help. But I don’t know the road to what to learn...
7/16/21, 7:43 PM - Emrys: Most people here aren't C's students
7/16/21, 7:44 PM - +232 99 783218: that's why I hated bootstrap.

I only used it once for responsiveness and some cool designs.

After I learn Media Queries, I totally wiped it from all my code
7/16/21, 7:44 PM - Emrys: Learn the concept not the language or framework.
7/16/21, 7:45 PM - +232 99 783218: I have never been to a degree college.

I mostly learn and stick with what I like best
7/16/21, 7:45 PM - +91 90823 40547: Sorry...I thought most of the people here are from cse background..
7/16/21, 7:45 PM - +232 99 783218: True, the concept can make you learn any framework you need.

I tried Bulma.io few months ago, and it was so easy because I already have the CSS concepts
7/16/21, 7:46 PM - +232 99 783218: naaah😁 even the outside world, most of the gurus are not from CSE background or some were but they didn't complete or liked it enough
7/16/21, 7:46 PM - Emrys: Ask yourself this question, 
I am a java programmer and the company I work with has decided to switch all Thier code base to python in the next one month can I cope
7/16/21, 7:47 PM - +91 90823 40547: Cool, that's inspiring..Your persistence in learning is inspiring..
7/16/21, 7:48 PM - +232 99 783218: The key for me is curiosity.

I get curious quickly, and I also take it as an hobby.

Makes things less hard.
7/16/21, 7:48 PM - +232 99 783218: Also don't over learn your mind, you will face burnout and get extremely bored
7/16/21, 7:50 PM - +91 90823 40547: I see... Being from Non CSE background so a bit of an anomaly is created.. But now I feel good and inspiring .
7/16/21, 7:50 PM - +91 90823 40547: That's something to think about..
7/16/21, 7:51 PM - +232 99 783218: It's hard but you can make it. Also don't be afraid to ask questions and read articles a lot
7/16/21, 7:51 PM - +91 90823 40547: Yes absolutely.. Little curiosity about anything will definitely create impact..
7/16/21, 7:52 PM - +91 90823 40547: Yes definitely.. Thanks for answering..
7/16/21, 7:52 PM - +232 99 783218: Just ask for anything or any article. we would give out the best resources🤣🤣
7/16/21, 7:53 PM - +232 99 783218: I have about a 150 articles on my phone alone on 3 browsers🤣😹😹
7/16/21, 7:53 PM - +232 99 783218: and almost 200 on my computer, its just crazy.

Sometimes i end up closing the tabs because I hardly read the articles again
7/16/21, 7:53 PM - Emrys: https://www.google.com 
Has answers to all questions if you know the right syntax of asking your question
7/16/21, 7:54 PM - +91 90823 40547: I will definitely read..👍🏻
7/16/21, 7:54 PM - Emrys: With patience
7/16/21, 7:54 PM - +91 90823 40547: That's insane🔥😹
7/16/21, 7:54 PM - +91 90823 40547: Absolutely.. 💯
7/16/21, 7:55 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝 Mostly just use the key words, and you get a straight answers🤣😹
7/16/21, 7:56 PM - +232 99 783218: Its a journey all of us go through
7/16/21, 8:06 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Wow!! I was just smiling reading through the comments, this is a mini discord!
7/16/21, 8:07 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Every and Amy help we can get along the way is always welcomed.

7/16/21, 8:16 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nice. Now use some inline styles to make the image cover the whole width of the screen, create padding on either side of the texts, and put an underline on the page header.
7/16/21, 8:23 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah
7/16/21, 8:24 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool start
7/16/21, 8:24 PM - +232 99 783218: You know box model is also hard to learn a little😁
7/16/21, 8:25 PM - +232 99 783218: I had to spend most of my time trying to understand padding from margin.

Bucky's tutorial helped with that
7/16/21, 8:27 PM - +234 902 396 6260: But do you know the difference now??
7/16/21, 8:30 PM - +234 803 643 9441: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 8:31 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Great. You can pull this off.
7/16/21, 8:31 PM - +232 99 783218: yes, and man it was a lot of practice i had to go through
7/16/21, 8:32 PM - +232 99 783218: perfect, the blue background color is a bit too much.

try using skyblue or royalblue😁
7/16/21, 8:34 PM - +234 803 643 9441: <Media omitted>
7/16/21, 8:39 PM - +232 99 783218: see the difference now??
7/16/21, 8:39 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Yes. It's beautiful
7/16/21, 8:43 PM - +234 812 073 4527: One of the major tips in becoming successful in life is consistency. Therefore, if you wanna be a pro as a developer you need to be consistent and then understand each language basics before moving to another
7/16/21, 8:57 PM - +232 99 783218: true, the more you practice the more it gets easy
7/16/21, 8:58 PM - +232 99 783218: Quick tip, 80% of frontend developers can't design 😹🤣
7/16/21, 8:58 PM - +263 77 291 9712: and networking
7/16/21, 8:59 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Yes, designing and development are different. a few engineers posses both
7/16/21, 9:00 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, Designing is hard, I really admire designers.
7/16/21, 9:00 PM - +234 803 643 9441: What's the difference between Front End, Back End and Full Stack developers ?
7/16/21, 9:00 PM - +232 99 783218: I just find inspiration from different sites and take the best part and try to build them
7/16/21, 9:01 PM - +232 99 783218: Frontend deals with what you see.

Backend deals with the data and how to store it

Fullstack is doing both
7/16/21, 9:01 PM - +232 99 783218: its more complex than this, but its how I see it
7/16/21, 9:02 PM - +234 812 073 4527: 👍🏽👍🏽 I find it to network (I'm an introvert) myself which makes it difficult for me in growing fast in my learning days
7/16/21, 9:03 PM - +234 812 073 4527: 👍🏽👍🏽 but it's nice to have basic visual design concept it will help you alot
7/16/21, 9:03 PM - +263 77 291 9712: lol, try to come out of that shell. network, find people similar to you and at the same level, grow together, learn from them and they learn from u, utilise platforms like github and online forums and groups like these ones
7/16/21, 9:04 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah thats why I am learning it as I go.

I have become much better than when I started
7/16/21, 9:05 PM - +263 77 291 9712: The nice thing about software engineering and ICT as a whole you dont really need to go to school to learn most of these skills
7/16/21, 9:05 PM - +232 99 783218: I am an introvert as well, but I try my best to network but mostly with other developers and forums like this one.


What has helped me, is asking a lot of questions and sharing my own answers
7/16/21, 9:05 PM - +232 99 783218: Even if I don't understand a concept i will read through the comments and ask what it is useful for
7/16/21, 9:06 PM - +263 77 291 9712: True, even if you have silly questions ask, when you learn them those skills wont go anywhere
7/16/21, 9:06 PM - +234 803 643 9441: So who deals with development and who deals with design ?
7/16/21, 9:07 PM - +234 812 073 4527: This will be my second forum though
7/16/21, 9:07 PM - +234 812 073 4527: I spend most times on google and stackoverflow.com
7/16/21, 9:08 PM - +232 99 783218: It can be both, but on a huge team, Designers are there for each designs the user should see.

Everything else is done by the developers
7/16/21, 9:10 PM - +232 99 783218: Mine is on Dev.to and code🤣
7/16/21, 10:11 PM - +234 805 764 0156: I repair laptop too

7/16/21, 10:14 PM - +234 805 764 0156: That might be some power issue
7/16/21, 10:15 PM - +234 805 764 0156: What is the model of the laptop
7/16/21, 10:15 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Hp15

7/17/21, 2:09 AM - Gold: I am a Machine Learning Engineer and I really love what I do, I found out that a lot of people love what I do but are scared of beginning it because they are scared of some unreasonable complexities so I started this series to try and change that.

7/17/21, 5:42 AM - Williams: Good morning, I'm learning js.But,I still do not understand what is the function of the return statement. How do I know when to use querySelector and get ElementById ?
7/17/21, 5:59 AM - Emrys: Queryselector is used to get the first element matching the select query while queryselectorall is used to get all elements matching the query.

Queryselector can be used to get element by Thier tagname, class name, Id while getelementbyid is only used to get elements by Thier id

7/17/21, 6:29 AM - Emrys: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/17/21, 6:42 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Firstly, do you know HTML and CSS?? Query selector uses same selector as CSS, where you can target specific elements by their tag name, class name,  id, data-type, psuedo classes. If the selector isn't a valid CSS syntax it won't  work.
getElementById, very self explanatory, only gets elements by their id. So, if an element doesn't have an id, you can't use getElementById.
7/17/21, 7:19 AM - +234 814 414 9628: This should be interesting... I just checked it out. 

Please share the link as soon as a new article in the series is ready 🙌🏻
7/17/21, 7:37 AM - Williams: Thanks.
7/17/21, 7:37 AM - Williams: Thanks
7/17/21, 8:08 AM - +234 706 696 3822: @2348036439441 you can also find this helpful, idk if anyone has suggested this... As a beginner, you can check other simple websites and try and building something similar to them, it could be one of those old website... Like the home page of waptrick.com or any other website, then later on you can move from there to build your own idea... You would have been conversant with how a standard website should be like by using other websites and improving on them and creating a unique website will be a bit easy for you later on.
7/17/21, 8:10 AM - +234 803 643 9441: Wow. This is great! 
My friend suggested this to me. 
I'll do something about it 😊
Thank you very much
7/17/21, 8:11 AM - +234 706 696 3822: Thank God man🤜🤛
7/17/21, 8:35 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Good morning and afternoon all.
Tip for newbies: NO QUESTION IS SILLY. Ask the question no matter how stupid it may seem. It is better to know than to assume. Have a pleasant day.
7/17/21, 8:41 AM - +232 99 783218: and also while doing that, after few practice (like 10 websites)

Try creating your portfolio site then improve on it as you learn
7/17/21, 8:42 AM - +232 99 783218: don't worry about the design at the start, just make sure u understand then u design.
7/17/21, 8:42 AM - +232 99 783218: Morning everyone 🙌🙌🙌
7/17/21, 8:42 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Morning chief.

Lord have mercy. I'm a newbie please
7/17/21, 8:46 AM - +234 902 396 6260: A portfolio site is like your CV as a web developer.
7/17/21, 8:49 AM - +232 99 783218: How are you doing bro,
7/17/21, 8:50 AM - +232 99 783218: benjithorpe.github.io
7/17/21, 8:52 AM - +232 99 783218: its still bad, very bad😹🤣🤣

I have given up on it few months ago.

my initial design was stolen by my classmate, so I had to change it to something else.

I came up with this in an angry mood.

Will rebuild it later when I have chance and try to buy my domain name
7/17/21, 8:52 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹😹 technically we are all newbies
7/17/21, 8:54 AM - +234 803 643 9441: I'm good. Still learning css and perfecting my html
7/17/21, 8:55 AM - +232 99 783218: cool
7/17/21, 8:57 AM - Williams: Can someone please help me explain the concept of the return statement in the best way I can understand pls
7/17/21, 8:58 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Your github is fire!!!
I've got a ton of projects I should push out but i feel there're not standard enough yet.
7/17/21, 8:58 AM - +234 909 602 6989: I think it helps kill the code, as soon as it achieves what the method is meant to achieve
7/17/21, 8:59 AM - +234 909 602 6989: I might be wrong, I'm new to this 🥲
7/17/21, 8:59 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Return statement is what you want the function to perform, and stops the the code once that action is performed.
7/17/21, 8:59 AM - Emrys: It is used to quit a function or return a value from it
7/17/21, 9:03 AM - Williams: Can i get concise example that explains it?
7/17/21, 9:05 AM - +234 902 396 6260: function squaresOfNumber(arg){
          return (arg * arg)
}
7/17/21, 9:05 AM - Emrys: What language
7/17/21, 9:05 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I think JS.
7/17/21, 9:06 AM - Gold: Thank you very much 🔥❤️

7/17/21, 10:44 AM - +232 99 783218: I tried once to write articles, but I'm no good.

But i will go at it again soon
7/17/21, 11:08 AM - Gold: No good?
7/17/21, 11:08 AM - Gold: I'll send you a message
7/17/21, 11:36 AM - +232 99 783218: Ok
7/17/21, 12:33 PM - +254 727 870371: I actually tried this today, mine took literally a blink of an eye
7/17/21, 1:39 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Yeah.. I think mine was due to so many extensions I downloaded on my VSCode
7/17/21, 3:52 PM - +254 727 870371: 👍🏾👍🏾
7/17/21, 5:29 PM - +232 99 783218: Remove the ones you don't need.

I only have one extension downloaded on VSCode
7/17/21, 6:52 PM - +234 814 414 9628: That's the issue...

I have extensions for CSS, Python, HTML, React and a few others... And I use them all
7/17/21, 6:53 PM - +234 814 414 9628: If there was a way to disable them temporarily
7/17/21, 7:21 PM - +234 813 850 5782: u can disable extensions in vscode temporatily
7/17/21, 7:25 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Really.. How?
7/17/21, 7:31 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah there is a disable button.
7/17/21, 7:32 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Wait for real?

7/18/21, 5:26 PM - Emrys: On fire
7/18/21, 6:22 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Awesome!! I need this level of design skill.
7/18/21, 6:27 PM - +263 77 291 9712: It's a wordpress site right?
7/18/21, 6:33 PM - Gold: You're welcome 🔥❤️❤️
7/18/21, 6:33 PM - Gold: I know right
7/18/21, 6:33 PM - Gold: Doesn't matter, even with WordPress this is real complex
7/18/21, 6:39 PM - +263 77 291 9712: I never meant it in a wrong way. Wordpress and Wix sites are easier to build and are better looking and has better SEO than the ones you build yourself
7/18/21, 6:39 PM - +263 77 291 9712: and have better functionality too
7/18/21, 6:40 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Using wordpress doesnt mean you are bad, its just like driving a semi automatic car
7/18/21, 6:41 PM - Temi: Yep
7/18/21, 6:41 PM - +263 77 291 9712: and the site is really good, well done
7/18/21, 6:41 PM - Temi: Thanks for the kind words guys🤗
7/18/21, 6:41 PM - +263 77 291 9712: That's awesome. The site is really good. Keep it up
7/18/21, 6:42 PM - Temi: Thanks
7/18/21, 6:49 PM - Gold: Haha I know you didn't

7/18/21, 7:16 PM - Emrys: WordPress or no wordpress we should all hail people's work
7/18/21, 7:16 PM - Emrys: Different aims and goals
7/18/21, 7:16 PM - +234 902 396 6260: It's simple and beautiful. Most times, I just dump all the colors I find cool on a site and it ends up looking like 2year old's painting.
7/18/21, 7:17 PM - Emrys: To me website is cool when the layout is simple
7/18/21, 7:17 PM - Emrys: For example google
7/18/21, 7:17 PM - Emrys: Always compact and less color
7/18/21, 7:19 PM - Temi: Thank you. I drew inspiration from several jewelry websites so that helped.
7/18/21, 7:19 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Wordpress is already work.
7/18/21, 7:22 PM - Emrys: A glass of wine to all in the  house 🍸 for all the good work and consistency
7/18/21, 7:22 PM - Emrys: Even if it's virtual
7/18/21, 7:23 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I don't mind, any excuse to have a twist is welcomed. Cheers to good work and consistency 🍺
7/18/21, 7:59 PM - +234 703 304 1157: Awesome 😎👍
7/18/21, 8:11 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool
7/18/21, 8:12 PM - +232 99 783218: I hardly use colors now, when I tried it, I became worse at colors.

so now I just create plain sites with few colors
7/18/21, 8:14 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Wow the animation is cool
7/18/21, 8:18 PM - +234 703 304 1157: How is the database and payment cards added?
7/18/21, 8:23 PM - Temi: Paystack plugin for payment
7/18/21, 8:25 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I really like how this looks.👏🏻👏🏻
7/18/21, 8:25 PM - +234 706 073 8426: This is nice ... try and edit the footer
7/18/21, 8:34 PM - Temi: Okay thanks
7/18/21, 8:35 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I noticed that the anklets and wedding ring links on the "shop by category" section both takes me to necklaces, but it's nothing a little edit can't fix. The overall look and feel is just beautiful. I'm really inspired.
7/18/21, 8:36 PM - Temi: Oh yeah that was deliberate 😅. There are no products in those pages yet so I just decided to redirect.
Thanks for your kind words 🙏😊
7/18/21, 8:37 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The count doesn't show when I add an item twice until I check the cart. And the cart is supposed to be always visible, right??
7/18/21, 8:38 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Oh lol that makes sense😁
7/18/21, 8:44 PM - Temi: Um.. Well, yes. When you check the cart, you can see the count for each item.
No, the cart isn't always visible. It's at the top right corner in desktop view and in the mobile menu in mobile view. 

I could alter it such that the cart is visible for a few seconds after you add to cart though. I just didn't think it was necessary
7/18/21, 8:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Some people are very absentminded tho, they may need to see how much items they've got in their cart. And having to switch back and forth between the cart and home page may tire some out. My opinion tho.
7/18/21, 8:46 PM - Temi: That makes sense. 
Thank you
7/18/21, 8:50 PM - +234 902 396 6260: You're welcome. This is why we're here to help each other get better.

7/19/21, 4:17 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Who done did this?!! 😂😂😂
7/19/21, 4:18 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Not done with reading it and then subscribing 🙌🏻

7/19/21, 4:35 PM - Gold: Oh😅

Glad you learned something.

I started a series on Machine Learning and that's article is part of it. 

I'll also write on data cleaning, building ML models, reinforcement learning, computer vision etc..

Thank you .

I'm glad you got value from it
7/19/21, 4:36 PM - Gold: Haha seriously
7/19/21, 4:36 PM - Gold: Even the calls help 😅
7/19/21, 4:37 PM - Temi: This is really great
7/19/21, 4:38 PM - Gold: Thank you very much 😅
Did you get value from it?
7/19/21, 4:42 PM - Temi: Yeah. I love that you used simple terminology. It was easy to flow even though I know next to nothing about machine learning
7/19/21, 5:06 PM - Gold: Haha, I feel a lot of the fear people have of Machine learning is due to those unnecessary complex terms.

It stops people from going into Machine Learning and makes them feel they need to have a degree or something.

It's not true, anyone can do ML.

And I plan to make that happen
7/19/21, 5:07 PM - Gold: I'm working on an open source project, a github repo with coded explanations of Machine Learning concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, Computer vision, natural Language processing and stuff like that
7/19/21, 5:07 PM - Gold: Do you all think that will help
7/19/21, 5:08 PM - Eke: Cool. Share the link
7/19/21, 5:14 PM - Gold: I'm not yet done
7/19/21, 5:15 PM - Gold: I should be push tonight
7/19/21, 5:15 PM - Gold: I'll surely send the link here
7/19/21, 5:18 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Can anyone suggest a better tutorial for linux
7/19/21, 5:47 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Yeah.. I do have dis a project idea. Although I do not know what language or tech stack to use, I guess it a machine learning thing.

7/19/21, 8:08 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Thanks
7/19/21, 8:17 PM - +234 813 110 8177: 🥲🥲
7/19/21, 9:45 PM - Gold: Really

Tell me about it
7/19/21, 10:16 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I've thinking about an open source project we can build. Although dis is country specific.

I'm thinking we could build an app that gives  information about the safe and unsafe places in Nigeria.  map of Nigeria and a tag that indicates a danger zone or a safe zone. Then a list of all the regions in Nigeria  sorted by the level of insecurities reported in each region. So a region could be marked as safe or unsafe based on recent news report. 

It similar to the covid-19 report based on countries in the world.
7/19/21, 10:20 PM - +234 808 627 9501: Where will we get data from?
7/19/21, 10:26 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow cool, I'd love to join the band.
7/19/21, 10:26 PM - +232 99 783218: Well I think for now, let's just build the UI then figure out how to get the data
7/19/21, 10:27 PM - +232 99 783218: maybe we can even make a review type of thing or poll so the data will be easy and automatic
7/19/21, 10:30 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Great idea.
7/19/21, 10:30 PM - +234 902 396 6260: That's the spirit! Start somewhere.
7/19/21, 10:31 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Web scraping?? Surveys??
7/19/21, 10:34 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Search by place, level of insecurity, most recent events.
7/19/21, 10:35 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, constant survey can be the first step, then later we find a way to do it automatically
7/19/21, 10:35 PM - +232 99 783218: yep, cool features for later.

Lets get something up and running first, then add functionality as we go
7/19/21, 10:43 PM - Gold: Well I think this could work
7/19/21, 10:43 PM - Gold: We could make use of the Google API or any other map API available free
7/19/21, 10:43 PM - Gold: But the day would be tricky
7/19/21, 10:44 PM - Gold: Any suggestions?
7/19/21, 10:44 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Day??
7/19/21, 10:45 PM - Gold: Sorry data 😅
7/19/21, 10:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok.
7/19/21, 10:45 PM - Gold: Maybe we could leave the data to users
7/19/21, 10:45 PM - Gold: Like Users who live in an area that's unsafe flag that area
7/19/21, 10:45 PM - Gold: What do you guys think
7/19/21, 10:47 PM - Gold: But I haven't figured out where Machine Learning could come into play
7/19/21, 10:47 PM - +234 902 396 6260: If there'll be a way to filter and verify the data from users, great. But leaving users to add sensitive information may be risky, in that people may use it for malicious purposes.
7/19/21, 10:47 PM - Gold: Explain malicious
7/19/21, 10:49 PM - +232 99 783218: yep, so that's why the polls and survey will be great.
7/19/21, 10:49 PM - +234 703 983 1390: I stayed a course in machine learning recently too….treating supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning now….it’s been cool so far
7/19/21, 10:49 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Some people could perhaps for sake of manipulating the populace flag a safe area as unsafe, either for economical, political or personal reasons.
7/19/21, 10:50 PM - +232 99 783218: Instead of users adding information, we will collect information from the polls and surveys then add them in the site
7/19/21, 10:50 PM - Emrys: Providing api
7/19/21, 10:52 PM - +232 99 783218: something like that
7/19/21, 10:53 PM - +234 808 627 9501: That's true
7/19/21, 10:54 PM - +234 808 627 9501: I'm loving this
7/19/21, 10:57 PM - Gold: So are we on board with using users flags to provide data on unsafe areas?
7/19/21, 11:00 PM - +234 902 396 6260: With verification, yes.
7/19/21, 11:10 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Wow!! This is a nice idea
7/19/21, 11:11 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ok this is interesting. What stack will be used?
7/19/21, 11:14 PM - +234 817 131 5756: The stack is the problem. To source data is another problem. I guess it is a machine learning thing.
7/19/21, 11:17 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Uh-oh, I know nothing about machine learning at the moment
7/19/21, 11:21 PM - +232 99 783218: well I don't think we need a backend for now.

we just need API to talk to
7/19/21, 11:22 PM - +234 817 131 5756: The first step is to get the data from the users. Polls and surveys is sounds nice. 
If we could source the data from surveys or user Input for example.
7/19/21, 11:32 PM - +232 99 783218: yep that would be great
7/19/21, 11:34 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Suggestion on our first step. Start an open source project on GitHub or wait for the survey?
7/19/21, 11:37 PM - +232 99 783218: we start first, then after we complete some core parts of the UI, we go for survey and polls.
7/19/21, 11:37 PM - +232 99 783218: we can move up from there
7/20/21, 12:05 AM - Gold: Okay so when do we begin
7/20/21, 12:06 AM - +232 99 783218: Let's all decide,
7/20/21, 12:07 AM - Gold: Okay
7/20/21, 12:07 AM - Gold: We need a place to talk
7/20/21, 12:07 AM - Gold: Do we use the group
7/20/21, 12:07 AM - +232 99 783218: It would be nice if @2348171315756 would open the repo
7/20/21, 12:07 AM - Gold: I can handle any of the ML stuff involved
7/20/21, 12:08 AM - +232 99 783218: Great,
7/20/21, 12:08 AM - Gold: Or like a Microsoft team account?
7/20/21, 12:10 AM - +232 99 783218: Or even Discord could be easy
7/20/21, 12:14 AM - Gold: Okay
7/20/21, 12:14 AM - Gold: So..m

7/20/21, 12:57 AM - +234 817 131 5756: What should we call it. Any idea?
7/20/21, 1:44 AM - Gold: Safespots😅
7/20/21, 1:44 AM - Gold: So are we going with slack, discord or Microsoft teams
7/20/21, 1:44 AM - Gold: Or all😅
7/20/21, 2:24 AM - +232 99 783218: I personally don't like Microsoft🤣😹

So Slack or Discord
7/20/21, 2:24 AM - +232 99 783218: 😁cool instant name
7/20/21, 6:15 AM - Bayo: Good morning beautiful people 💃💃💃

Its' been a while here 🤗

But do you still know why every developer you meet on how to get started will tell you to learn *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript* for a start?

It also took me a while to realize that.

Check out the *Skeleton of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT* article on my blog below

https://unclebigbay.com/skeleton-of-html-css-and-javascript

Where I explained why these languages are a must for every new and old developers

See you in the article 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
7/20/21, 6:39 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Wow... Using the human body to illustrate the functions of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is top-notch 🙌🏻.

Again, the images and gifs you used were so on point. 

Lemme sign under your tutelage boss 🙏
7/20/21, 7:14 AM - Bayo: wow. thanks a lot for the feedback and the likes. I appreciate that.

Also glad you found it helpful and interesting.

I am actually not the real boss @2347066985640 , @2348105729893  @917658925527  , @2347039831390  and others are the real boss
7/20/21, 7:17 AM - +234 814 414 9628: You're welcome bro.

I actually would like to know where I can get such clear and useful gifs that you used. 🙏
7/20/21, 7:18 AM - Bayo: I googled and pick what goes well with the content
7/20/21, 7:19 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Cool... So you could find such gifs in HD on google?

I'd try that then. Thank you
7/20/21, 7:20 AM - Bayo: yes sir.
7/20/21, 9:03 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Great article. Even a 5 year old would find it easy to understand.
7/20/21, 9:09 AM - +234 905 591 4191: Great
7/20/21, 9:12 AM - +91 90823 40547: Hello everyone...
I've completed front end web development..
Now I'm looking forward to learn backend 
But I'm not sure how to start with back end development..
I know Python programming...
7/20/21, 9:12 AM - +91 90823 40547: Plz give suggestions/advices
7/20/21, 9:12 AM - Emrys: 🙇🏼‍♂️🙇🏼‍♂️🙇🏼‍♂️🙇🏼‍♂️🙇🏼‍♂️
7/20/21, 9:12 AM - +234 907 777 1659: Start with Node Js, Deepen your knowledge of Python
7/20/21, 9:13 AM - +234 907 777 1659: Mongo DB and Express are wonderful languages too while using frame works like Flask..
7/20/21, 9:14 AM - +234 902 396 6260: 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I think NodeJS offers a lot. Along with MongoDB and Express, the ME-N stack.
7/20/21, 9:14 AM - +91 90823 40547: So should I start with NodeJS?
7/20/21, 9:15 AM - +234 907 777 1659: And Angular to that and it becomes the MEAN Stack😂
7/20/21, 9:15 AM - +234 907 777 1659: It’s all your choice but I’ll advise you start with NodeJs
7/20/21, 9:16 AM - +91 90823 40547: Okay🙏🏻🤝🏻
7/20/21, 9:16 AM - +234 805 281 7283: Great article @2348083826262 !
7/20/21, 9:16 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Choice. PHP is slowly getting push back, so it's advisable to go with what is in demand. And apparently, NodeJS offers a lot, from what I've heard.
7/20/21, 9:20 AM - +91 90823 40547: Okay.. Will start with NodeJS
7/20/21, 10:13 AM - +91 90823 40547: If you take info from login page, how to display it on another page?
7/20/21, 10:15 AM - Emrys: Send to backend using http post or get methods then insert in the other page and return it as response

7/20/21, 10:16 AM - Emrys: Flask abi
7/20/21, 10:16 AM - +91 90823 40547: Using flask
7/20/21, 10:16 AM - +91 90823 40547: API
7/20/21, 10:26 AM - +234 904 757 9949 left
7/20/21, 10:31 AM - Emrys: <Media omitted>
7/20/21, 10:32 AM - Emrys: Here is a sample of flask app I just wrote that does what you asked
7/20/21, 10:32 AM - +91 90823 40547: Thanks a lot mate🙏🏻
7/20/21, 10:34 AM - Emrys: If you run this on an android device and you put on its hotspot and connect any device to the network you can access the simple web app on it
7/20/21, 10:35 AM - Emrys: Then also using ngrok you can make it go to the internet while the server is running on your phone or computer
7/20/21, 10:35 AM - +91 90823 40547: Okay
7/20/21, 10:35 AM - +91 90823 40547: Thanks a lot
7/20/21, 10:37 AM - Gold: Okay😅
7/20/21, 10:38 AM - Gold: Omo I'm not a boss abeg 🙌🙌
7/20/21, 11:04 AM - +232 99 783218: don't go into it directly, try and make sure you build a lot of things in frontend and get extremely comfortable and boring doing it.

Then you can switch to backend
7/20/21, 11:14 AM - +91 90823 40547: Okay.. first I'll spend more time on frontend and then will go into backend..
7/20/21, 11:16 AM - Emrys: Think of projects that require more frontend little backend then do don't keep waiting if it were up to me.
7/20/21, 11:19 AM - Emrys: http://program-hub.herokuapp.com/learn/project/Web%20dictionary:%20flask

Simple projects like this.
7/20/21, 11:34 AM - +91 90823 40547: Yes sure..🤝🏻
7/20/21, 11:34 AM - +234 703 983 1390: Well…..I am honored boss but I ain’t a boss yet😌😌🤲🏾

7/20/21, 11:43 AM - +44 7398 105965: Any recommendation tutorial on image gallery modal?
7/20/21, 1:59 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Hello dev's .. I designed this with HTML AND CSS..

Help me review the design and the layout or you can also assist to restructure some layouts.. I need your opinion and reviews
7/20/21, 1:59 PM - +234 813 581 6889: I will drop the source files asap
7/20/21, 2:03 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Can I ask, why put placeholder text "Lorem ipsum" if you wrote the code yourself? 🤔
7/20/21, 2:06 PM - +234 813 581 6889: That's the dummy text I used..

You can use it if you are in a haste or you don't know what to write at the time of coding...

Just type lorem in vscode and it will generate the text for you..

I sincerely did that from scratch all by myself
7/20/21, 2:08 PM - +234 811 429 7496: why would anyone want to put a project they didn't write themselves here
7/20/21, 2:09 PM - +263 77 291 9712: I know about lorem, my point is, what's the sole purpose of using lorem when u just just create the project you already building
7/20/21, 2:09 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Thats exactly my question
7/20/21, 2:09 PM - +44 7398 105965: Hello everyone

7/20/21, 2:16 PM - +234 813 581 6889: I did this..some weeks back..
7/20/21, 2:17 PM - +263 77 291 9712: You can share the files and we help
7/20/21, 2:18 PM - Bayo: 😂 That's the goal

Thanks boss 🙌🏼🙌🏼
7/20/21, 2:18 PM - Bayo: Thanks 😊
7/20/21, 2:18 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Is this just for practice or its a project

7/20/21, 3:10 PM - +234 813 581 6889: The right top menu..

It needs JavaScript
7/20/21, 3:11 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Use a checkbox.
7/20/21, 3:12 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Ok...

How does that work
7/20/21, 3:13 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Or a div, if you will.
7/20/21, 3:14 PM - +234 813 581 6889: @2349023966260 .

That's the source code .. try contributing to the project

7/20/21, 4:01 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Thanks
7/20/21, 4:02 PM - +234 902 396 6260: It would take a while as I'm not with my laptop right now, I'm celebrating with my family for today.
7/20/21, 4:11 PM - +234 813 581 6889: That's good
7/20/21, 5:36 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Discord make sense.

Which frontend stack would be better? I use ReactJS but I guess some guys here would prefer other frameworks. 
Or should we just use vanilla js? Everybody would be able to contribute to the project if we use vanilla js. 
What about the UI design? It would be better we'll have visual representation of what we want to build.
7/20/21, 6:07 PM - Gold: Okay
7/20/21, 6:07 PM - Gold: What do you want
7/20/21, 6:10 PM - Emrys: I want yiu
7/20/21, 6:10 PM - Emrys: You
7/20/21, 6:24 PM - Gold: <Media omitted>
7/20/21, 6:39 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow, cool design and the blend of colors is awesome
7/20/21, 6:40 PM - Emrys: 🤣🤣🤣
7/20/21, 6:40 PM - +232 99 783218: Most people do will do that, I do it all the time😹😹

I hardly know what to write for my projects
7/20/21, 6:41 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Exactly🙇
7/20/21, 6:41 PM - +232 99 783218: The best websites for shortcuts.
7/20/21, 6:42 PM - +232 99 783218: W3School is a good place for that
7/20/21, 6:42 PM - +263 77 291 9712: hahaha I was just asking to understand, most of I project I will knowinf what needs to go there so I just put it like that. For example before I start writing code I design the layout of a paper and know what goes where, then as I writing code I would pretty much try to match what I would have drawn on the paper
7/20/21, 6:43 PM - +263 77 291 9712: SO I find it wasting time putting lorum and other placeholder images etc when I already have designed the layout and know exactly what I wanna put there
7/20/21, 6:44 PM - +263 77 291 9712: But we always have different ways of working, if putting lorem and placeholder images etc then reedit after and have the time to so them thats cool
7/20/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: How do you guys do this kind of screenshot😮😮😮 the full website
7/20/21, 6:45 PM - +232 99 783218: I use Svelte, but Vanilla JavaScript will be the best to go with, and since we are plenty, maintenance will be a little bit easier if we forget to copy and paste a section
7/20/21, 6:46 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Inspect the element .

Then you will see a small icon at the top right corner.. click on it and select your options
7/20/21, 6:46 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow cool😁 I always have a design but always have a problem with words🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
7/20/21, 6:47 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow cool, thanks for that.
7/20/21, 6:48 PM - +263 77 291 9712: Me too, my gf usually help with words, so I always make sure I have the whole site drawn on a paper, words, layout, colors etc available. Then as I start writing code I will try by all means to match the drawings
7/20/21, 6:48 PM - +232 99 783218: cool,
7/20/21, 6:49 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Brilliant..

We that don't have one nko
7/20/21, 6:50 PM - +263 77 291 9712: We all have different strategies, the nice thing we all get the job done
7/20/21, 6:50 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Sure sir...🔥
7/20/21, 7:42 PM - +232 99 783218: Yep true.

has Thomas created the repo??
7/20/21, 7:49 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Not yet. What about the design? honestly, I'd dismiss the idea already. So, Let's suggest how we'd go about the design and every other stuff.

And the discord, you'll create the group?
7/20/21, 7:51 PM - +232 99 783218: Y would you dismiss the idea🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

Maybe your idea would make other countries make one too for their nation
7/20/21, 7:51 PM - +232 99 783218: Its a beautiful idea bro.

for the design, should we go directly to showing the areas or something else??
7/20/21, 7:57 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Could we build a survey website where we could solicit response for user and then get data to save in the back end.  The we could present the data to the front-end.
7/20/21, 7:59 PM - +234 817 131 5756: 😏😏😏
7/20/21, 8:05 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool
7/20/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: Don't do that man
7/20/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: What's your idea for the design
7/20/21, 9:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: A google doc kinda thing.
7/20/21, 9:50 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Aye man, just got home. Have sorted the menu or you still need help??
7/20/21, 10:00 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Have not sort it out.
7/20/21, 10:02 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Do you use any CSS preprocessors??
7/20/21, 10:05 PM - +234 813 581 6889: No..
7/20/21, 10:06 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok. Pure CSS then.
7/20/21, 10:06 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Yes sir.🔥
7/20/21, 10:29 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm gonna send the zip to you now and you integrate into your code.
7/20/21, 10:30 PM - +234 902 396 6260: You can modify anyhow you see fit or I could if you want.
7/20/21, 10:37 PM - +234 808 627 9501: I think we should start on a smaller area and go bigger with time

Covering the whole country at once might be a bit challenging

It's just what I think
7/20/21, 10:38 PM - +232 99 783218: it's what i have been saying, we start small them improve as we grow
7/20/21, 10:38 PM - +234 902 396 6260: <Media omitted>
7/20/21, 10:39 PM - +234 808 627 9501: Yeah, I agree to it too
7/20/21, 11:11 PM - +234 813 850 5782: Instead of sending zip file to everybody why not push the code to GitHub then anybody that wish to contribute should pull and do their stuff
7/20/21, 11:15 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝
7/20/21, 11:19 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @2348135816889 You heard the men, push your code to github and let's request the pull.

7/21/21, 12:53 AM - +234 817 131 5756: @23299783218 where do you suggest we begin?
7/21/21, 4:28 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Hey guys good morning,
I have a problem with something i'm trying to build.
Could there be a situation where flex-wrap doesn't work?
7/21/21, 4:49 AM - Eke: flex-wrap won't do anything here. Change the flex direction to a column. Align it to the center
7/21/21, 4:49 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Like align content center?
7/21/21, 4:50 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Cos justify didn't work too,I had already tried thay?
7/21/21, 4:50 AM - +234 808 475 2572: That*
7/21/21, 4:53 AM - Eke: flex-direction: column;
align-items: center; 
justify-content: center;
7/21/21, 4:53 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Oh my God
Just worked like magic😅😅
7/21/21, 4:54 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Thank you very much🙏
7/21/21, 4:54 AM - +234 808 475 2572: But could you tell me any reason wrap didn't do anything there?
7/21/21, 5:05 AM - Eke: Wraps are not used for centering flex items. But for moving an item onto the next line if the width is at maximum.
7/21/21, 5:06 AM - Eke: It's kinda confusing, even to me. Not a fan of wraps.
7/21/21, 5:07 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Thanks👍🏻
7/21/21, 5:08 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Even read an article now about that,still confused lol
7/21/21, 5:09 AM - Eke: Lol. You're welcome.
7/21/21, 5:59 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Thanks...
7/21/21, 5:59 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Ok....

I will as soon as possible
7/21/21, 6:46 AM - +234 902 396 6260: You're welcome. Did you insert in your code already??
7/21/21, 8:04 AM - +232 99 783218: Because of the width and since the items are not large enough to make it wrap
7/21/21, 8:05 AM - +232 99 783218: By creating the repo, then sending the repo link.

Then we plan how to do the design
7/21/21, 8:05 AM - +232 99 783218: I hardly use it, I just don't see the need.
7/21/21, 9:27 AM - Bayo: Good morning Ladies and Gents in Tech.

I am a programmer and I have no life 😭

There's an opportunity to better yourself as a developer, it's the HNG 8.0 internship. It's completely remote and anyone can apply. Although, there's no pay as there's a large turnout, the winning teams in group project get cash prizes. I personally feel want rise who are self taught to take on this challenge and make themselves better.

Here's the link: internship.zuri.team 

Next cohort starts August.
7/21/21, 7:22 PM - Gold: Okay bro thanks

7/21/21, 9:34 PM - Gold: Browse GitHub
7/21/21, 9:34 PM - Gold: Soo what can I do
7/21/21, 9:34 PM - Gold: I can't do design though 😅
7/21/21, 9:35 PM - Gold: @2348105729893 boss come and use your design talent
7/21/21, 9:35 PM - Segun: Abeg vn?
7/21/21, 9:36 PM - +232 99 783218: Once we have a design everything will be easy.
7/21/21, 9:37 PM - +232 99 783218: lets start with the easy things.

What do we want the user to see first time logging in??
7/21/21, 9:37 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Recent updates, news.
7/21/21, 9:37 PM - Gold: Why that
7/21/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: Why not something like the most unsecure places
7/21/21, 9:41 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I feel recent updates should be the first thing, then the user knows the information is up to date.
7/21/21, 9:41 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I agree with him/her
7/21/21, 9:41 PM - +234 808 627 9501: Will the update be different for each user?
7/21/21, 9:41 PM - +232 99 783218: what if we just start by showing the location names first, and a tag to show whether it is safe or not
7/21/21, 9:42 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Him sir.
7/21/21, 9:42 PM - +232 99 783218: then later we add a filter and also a map as we go
7/21/21, 9:42 PM - +234 808 627 9501: Yeah, I think this is it for me
7/21/21, 9:43 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nope. Just recent happenings around the country.
7/21/21, 9:43 PM - +232 99 783218: example.

Name -> _safe_
Name -> _unsafe_

something like this above
7/21/21, 9:44 PM - +234 902 396 6260: We could go with that.
7/21/21, 9:44 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝
7/21/21, 9:51 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I'd research some design ideas.

7/23/21, 8:46 PM - +234 814 414 9628: React is killing me from this end 😂
7/23/21, 8:46 PM - +234 814 414 9628: But what's the issue you're facing exactly
7/23/21, 8:47 PM - +44 7398 105965: I don't even seem to understand it, should I just
7/23/21, 8:48 PM - +44 7398 105965: How is the better way for easy grasping
7/23/21, 8:48 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Nice bro 👏... Should we be expecting a follow up article on version control with git?

I've never really understood what it means?
7/23/21, 8:49 PM - +234 814 414 9628: ~?~
7/23/21, 8:49 PM - +91 94535 50425: Yes sure, I am planning to create a detailed video also
7/23/21, 8:50 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Cool.... That'd be nice.. 😎
7/23/21, 8:51 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay.. Javascript object right?

What helped me was when I learnt about objects in Python. I believe the JavaScript gurus here can recommend go materials to learn about Objects in JavaScript
7/23/21, 8:51 PM - +234 814 414 9628: If I find one too, I'd share as well
7/23/21, 8:51 PM - +44 7398 105965: Thanks

Now array is people 

And people are made of of ?
7/23/21, 9:29 PM - +234 814 414 9628: A collection of persons ???

7/25/21, 5:35 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay.. Depends on the object..

Is it an array of objects or an object of objects?

7/25/21, 5:36 PM - +234 813 850 5782: object of objects
7/25/21, 5:38 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Please I cant see it well.. Do point to the line of code that produces the error?
7/25/21, 5:39 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Or take a screenshot of the json object here

7/25/21, 5:48 PM - +234 814 414 9628: To access the description value.. You should try weather.description
7/25/21, 5:48 PM - +234 813 850 5782: i tried that, nada
7/25/21, 5:50 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay... Firstly, you got the data from an API right?
7/25/21, 5:52 PM - +234 814 414 9628: You should have done something like .then(response => { data = response.json()})
7/25/21, 5:52 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Convert the data to json
7/25/21, 5:56 PM - +234 813 850 5782: <Media omitted>
7/25/21, 5:56 PM - +234 813 850 5782: this is the entry point
7/25/21, 5:57 PM - +234 813 850 5782: i got the data from an api, converted it to json
7/25/21, 5:57 PM - +234 813 850 5782: for this i tried, weather: {0: {description}}, still nada
7/25/21, 6:05 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay.. I would suggest you use console.log() in this process... Comment out any other thing you're outputting on the console. Then do console.log(data).. Let's see..

Then we can progress from there
7/25/21, 6:14 PM - +234 813 850 5782: ok will do that
7/25/21, 6:19 PM - +234 813 850 5782: if u notice from my code, i passed the state value 'weather' which contains the json object gotten from the api as a prop so that i can use it in 'UserLocationWeatherDetails' component, i then destructure it inside the component.. I was able to use some property/value I needed, but 'desceiption' that was nested inside the weather was retuning undefined
7/25/21, 6:30 PM - Bayo: I am curious 🤔

What if the recruiter asked you to mention 10 code editors apart from *VScode* and *IntelliJ*? 🤷‍♂️

can you? 😏


Before the day comes, checkout 10 code editors that you might not know 🤗

7/25/21, 6:45 PM - +234 814 414 9628: This will get the value for the description key and put it in an empty array. You can modify it to fit what you want to do

7/25/21, 7:42 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Hi everyone. Good evening and trust we all had a super Sunday.
  I have a question for all the bosses. 
What do you think about posting same content across two or more platforms?
 
Say for example, posting same  content on your  personal website's blog page and on a blogging site like hashnode.

Is this good practice?

@2348144149628  @2347066985640  @2348083826262  @2348105729893
7/25/21, 7:57 PM - Bayo: if you are specifying the canonical link, then it's fine
7/25/21, 7:58 PM - Bayo: canonical link is the original source of the content, and this helps google to index the right page when it encounter two contents on different platforms
7/25/21, 8:18 PM - +232 99 783218: Sublime Text
Xed (Linux)
Nano
Vim
Micro (terminal based)
Kate
Komodo
Atom
Brackets
Gedit
...etc
7/25/21, 8:19 PM - +232 99 783218: I think most platforms have a canonical link you can use, its mostly so search engines know which post is the original
7/25/21, 8:27 PM - +234 806 490 1390: Does this apply even if the content is yours?
7/25/21, 8:28 PM - +232 99 783218: yes, its mostly for search engine purpose, per my knowledge.
7/25/21, 8:48 PM - +234 814 414 9628: True it is. I know several top bloggers that post same article on different platforms too. Its not something bad as far as you specify the canonical link

7/27/21, 6:56 AM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹they are better, Sierra Leoneans want you to develop a big application and pay you little, like 200k or 500k (in dollars its just $20 or $50)😹😹
7/27/21, 6:59 AM - Gold: Mtcheew don't mind them
7/27/21, 6:59 AM - Gold: One developer sef can't build YouTube
7/27/21, 6:59 AM - Gold: It will be extremely hard and stressfull
7/27/21, 6:59 AM - Gold: 😅😅
7/27/21, 7:02 AM - +232 99 783218: Those guys are a mess.

And have a lovely day y'all.

7/27/21, 4:44 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @23299783218 I'm promise me I'm not gonna break my laptop but why is nothing showing up when I open my index.html file in the browser. I can see everything I did in svelte file show up in the browser.
7/27/21, 4:47 PM - +234 703 983 1390: <Media omitted>
7/27/21, 5:35 PM - +232 99 783218: 😁😁 because svelte has a tiny server build it
7/27/21, 5:35 PM - +232 99 783218: built in*
7/27/21, 5:36 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Yes,  I saw it in the rollup. I actually checked each file through.
7/27/21, 5:37 PM - +232 99 783218: first you can learn from the documentation, but if you want to code locally, do this step.

*npx degit sveltejs/template project-name*

*cd project-name*

*npm install*

*npm run dev*

the go to the browser and type.
*localhost:5000*
7/27/21, 5:37 PM - +232 99 783218: any changes you make after this will be automatically reloaded and update
7/27/21, 5:37 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I've actually built something.
7/27/21, 5:38 PM - +232 99 783218: cool, share the repo link, I will help when you need one
7/27/21, 5:40 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The html has content in it but it leads nowhere.
7/27/21, 5:41 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'll upload it to my repo and share the link soon.
7/27/21, 6:43 PM - +232 99 783218: ok,
7/27/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: all the code goes in components, (.svelte files)

only link to styles goes in the index.html.
7/27/21, 6:44 PM - +232 99 783218: I am planning to write a blog on svelte about my journey
7/27/21, 6:57 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Cool.
7/27/21, 7:16 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @23299783218 Here's the repo link github.com/pablo-clueless/Svelte-App
7/27/21, 7:38 PM - +232 99 783218: cool will take a look at it
7/27/21, 7:38 PM - +232 99 783218: 404 error
7/27/21, 7:40 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Yup. I deleted it out of frustration. I can't even understand what was pushed there. I've uninstalled my VSCode and trying to reinstall it 'cos I believe it's broken.
7/27/21, 7:46 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤣🤣🤣🤣welcome back to code
7/27/21, 7:49 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Hello
7/27/21, 7:49 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm crying bruv.
7/27/21, 7:50 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Been a while, been really bored since my laptop got spoilt. I miss coding
7/27/21, 7:52 PM - +232 99 783218: ooohh man take heart, you can read code or articles they help you learn without doing code
7/27/21, 7:53 PM - +234 803 643 9441: I read the tech twitter tho
7/27/21, 8:37 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool, you can read more at hashnode or dev.to
7/27/21, 8:46 PM - +234 803 643 9441: Thank you sparrow. You guys are great here
7/27/21, 9:03 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝u welcome
7/27/21, 9:08 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Guys, what will you advice someone who is not growing at work?? I mean he just keep doing the same work everyday
7/27/21, 9:12 PM - +232 99 783218: I'd suggest you find another, the quit the current one.

Its not good for developers to stay stagnant and not learning.
7/27/21, 9:13 PM - +232 99 783218: In the next few years, libraries will change the market and concepts updated and deprecated.

so find a place where you can learn and improve always
7/27/21, 9:37 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Thanks @23299783218
7/27/21, 9:39 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝
7/27/21, 10:33 PM - +234 902 396 6260: @23299783218 I upload the svelte code to my repo github.com/pablo-clueless/Svelte-APP
7/27/21, 10:35 PM - +232 99 783218: ok will look at it
7/27/21, 10:36 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Thanks chief.
7/27/21, 10:38 PM - +232 99 783218: can I ask how many days you have learned Svelte for🤔
7/27/21, 10:39 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Read some docs from Friday till Sunday.
7/27/21, 10:40 PM - +232 99 783218: 😨😨😨and you are already using event dispatcher.
7/27/21, 10:41 PM - +232 99 783218: bro take it easy little by little.

learn how to pass props, call components inside components and basic things like that.
7/27/21, 10:41 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The syntax was pretty easy to pick up. The import was similar to sass partials, only you had to include the actual path. The on:click is a bummer, the bind:value is the only thing I've seen that's different.
7/27/21, 10:42 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Calling props was just like creating a variable somewhere and calling it somewhere else, pretty simple to me.
7/27/21, 10:42 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I actually did the components thing on their site the first day you told me about it.
7/27/21, 10:43 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool, then try combining components.

and also try adding styles based on condition
7/27/21, 10:43 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I changed the global css, check it.
7/27/21, 10:43 PM - +232 99 783218: cool, well you have gone way ahead that i ever did in my first 2 weeks😁😁
7/27/21, 10:44 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm pretty big on reading, I assimilate pretty quickly when documentations are explicit.
7/27/21, 10:44 PM - +232 99 783218: mostly you would use custom CSS, you would hardly use global CSS
7/27/21, 10:44 PM - +234 902 396 6260: See hype o. You walked so I can run.
7/27/21, 10:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I like the global css thing, kinda like using sass or bootstrap.
7/27/21, 10:45 PM - +232 99 783218: same here, but I wasn't really focused at that time
7/27/21, 10:45 PM - +232 99 783218: cool, you can even use sass in svelte too
7/27/21, 10:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Like create scss files inside the public file??
7/27/21, 10:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: *public folder.
7/27/21, 10:47 PM - +234 902 396 6260: But the event dispatcher was tough, that was the only thing I didn't get on my first try.
7/27/21, 10:47 PM - +232 99 783218: nope, inside the components of it self, but I don't know if you can create one outside it.
7/27/21, 10:48 PM - +232 99 783218: I hardly use scss, i prefer vanilla css
7/27/21, 10:48 PM - +234 902 396 6260: TF?? How does it get compiled??
7/27/21, 10:48 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I love scss.
7/27/21, 10:49 PM - +232 99 783218: I have no idea🤣😹these guys are genius.

Svelte will take over all other frameworks with time to come
7/27/21, 10:49 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'll like to know tho.
7/27/21, 10:50 PM - +234 902 396 6260: But that event dispatcher was a tough but to crack, it was the only thing I didn't get right on my first try.
7/27/21, 11:07 PM - +232 99 783218: its a bit confusing at first, the ones i have problems with are stores.

I haven't really started learning it yet
7/27/21, 11:08 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Stores?? Please, lemme go back to reading the docks.
7/27/21, 11:09 PM - +234 902 396 6260: And I find the looping and conditionals very fun.
7/27/21, 11:10 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹😹
7/27/21, 11:10 PM - +232 99 783218: i use them every time😁😁 easy and cool to use
7/27/21, 11:11 PM - +234 902 396 6260: {#if}...{:else}...{/if}
7/27/21, 11:11 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Very cool syntax.
7/27/21, 11:12 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Most of the markup looks a lot like using ES6, particularly the props, but without $.
7/27/21, 11:12 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Thanks for bringing it to my notice.
7/27/21, 11:12 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah especially when I can just add something inside each one without disturbance
7/27/21, 11:13 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah almost everything is ES6, well wait till u start using reactive declaration.

the *:$* syntax
7/27/21, 11:14 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Can't wait but I'll wait.
7/27/21, 11:14 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'll probably do two more simple apps then read more docs.
7/27/21, 11:15 PM - +232 99 783218: cool
7/28/21, 3:50 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Please does it really matter the editor one uses ?
I use sublime and i'm cool with it
7/28/21, 4:17 AM - +234 907 777 1659: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 5:50 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Not at all, editors are a means to an end. We don't all have to use the same means of transportation to get to the same destination, what matters is we get there. Keep doing your thing 💪🏾
7/28/21, 5:52 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Just some of my guys making me feel less of who I am😆
Thanks bro
7/28/21, 6:58 AM - +232 99 783218: Nope it does not, I always use sublime, but since VSCode has more packages for frameworks i go for it
7/28/21, 6:59 AM - +232 99 783218: I always use sublime when am not doing any web related stuff or building just a simple website quickly
7/28/21, 6:59 AM - +234 807 859 1688: 🪑
7/28/21, 7:15 AM - +234 902 396 6260: @2348171315756 Good morning. Link to the Safe Place repo please. And what questions are we planning to ask in the form. I think I've got time to create a Google form.
7/28/21, 7:26 AM - +232 99 783218: ok cool,
7/28/21, 7:42 AM - +233 55 806 1770: Which country is +232 ?
7/28/21, 7:43 AM - +234 814 135 2896: Sierra Leone
7/28/21, 7:44 AM - +233 55 806 1770: Oh okay, cool
7/28/21, 8:19 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Hello.. Am using vscode.

 I downloaded the *sass live compiler* but it is not functioning accurately....

Is there another extension for sass compiler..
7/28/21, 8:22 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Also. How can I track lost phones..
7/28/21, 8:22 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Or who can help
7/28/21, 8:24 AM - +44 7398 105965: Morning guys, this is my second project built with html, Css and little javascript. Am I improving. Criticism is welcome. Thanks

7/28/21, 8:24 AM - Bayo: Good morning guys 🤗,

I have come again.

I am curious this time, how do you personally request feedbacks from people? 

I mean how do you make shy people and people who are not so close to you give you feedbacks 🤷‍♂️

How will you take it if someone comment on your social media post that *they do not like your last article or the design you did for your client?*

Kindly share your thoughts on this 🙏
7/28/21, 8:32 AM - +234 813 581 6889: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 8:34 AM - +232 99 783218: take it as constructive criticism.

personally, if someone says my design is not good, i take it like they are saying improve more on the colors or don't use colors
7/28/21, 8:36 AM - +44 7398 105965: Like?
7/28/21, 8:36 AM - +232 99 783218: Its perfect, especially the blend of colors.
7/28/21, 8:36 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Great. You did everything well. You could add this: separate the items into categories, e.g Corporate wears, dinner wears etc. And make the pictures smaller, and let them expand/shrink on touch.
7/28/21, 8:37 AM - +232 99 783218: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 8:37 AM - +44 7398 105965: OK
7/28/21, 8:37 AM - +44 7398 105965: OK
7/28/21, 8:37 AM - +232 99 783218: *Every wears* is not specific like the others
7/28/21, 8:38 AM - +234 902 396 6260: @447398105965 The colors are great tho, I could never combine colors properly.
7/28/21, 8:42 AM - +234 902 396 6260: @447398105965 I love how you linked up the pages, nice one. One feature you could add is testimonials/feedback - let new comers know what your existing customers are saying about you.
7/28/21, 8:42 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Deffo. Grammar has to be topnotch too.
7/28/21, 8:43 AM - +44 7398 105965: Alright, thanks. I will do that
7/28/21, 8:43 AM - Bayo: TRUE, but what if it's more personal feedback, and it's given publicly


how will you feel?

Knowing well it might hinder your chance of getting a new client or so
7/28/21, 8:43 AM - +44 7398 105965: Lol, don't mind me. Just had to put something so the work can move, that part delays my work a lot.
7/28/21, 8:44 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I've taken a more rather direct approach of sending the links to people and asking for feedback.
7/28/21, 8:45 AM - +232 99 783218: same here, i am very bad at colors
7/28/21, 8:46 AM - +232 99 783218: I would feel very bad, but in life, everyone is not the same no matter what.

so I would just move on after getting past it.
7/28/21, 8:46 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I hope to take some UI lessons when I'm based tho. I hate hunting for designs.
7/28/21, 8:47 AM - +232 99 783218: Oooh, I wanted to learn UI/UX but i am bad and addicted to colors.

Once I start putting colors, i get carried away and destroy the design
7/28/21, 8:55 AM - Bayo: uhmmm nice, nice

What about having a platform for this?
7/28/21, 8:56 AM - +234 902 396 6260: The same with me. I ruin everything with colors and animations.
7/28/21, 8:57 AM - Bayo: true, and I like your thinking sir

but do you think this can be solved if you have a link where people can send you feedbacks, like sharing it on your Twitter once or twice for feedback and get feedback from people anonymously
7/28/21, 8:59 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I was thinking of adding a rate/review button on my portfolio site but getting the feedback would be an issue as I don't know backend at all. Only used PHP and SQLite a few times.
7/28/21, 9:03 AM - Bayo: true sha, will make sense
7/28/21, 9:04 AM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹those things are fun to play with and cause a big mess too.

nowadays i just prefer to be plain white, or use the colors in the logos or use two colors
7/28/21, 9:06 AM - +232 99 783218: yeah, it might be solved but yet still just take every criticism as a stepping stone.

I have a long lasting memory, and it pains me.

Once someone says something bad to me, I'll never forget it
7/28/21, 9:07 AM - Bayo: uhmmm, true.
7/28/21, 9:07 AM - Bayo: Still on the feedback matter

*Introducing: The Anonymous Feedback Platform built with the CHERN stack*

I developed a platform *(The Anonymous Feedback)* where people who need feedbacks can signup as a receiver and share their unique feedback URL to get feedback from people anonymously.

The gap this platform is filling is the lack of confidence between people giving feedback and the receiver.

Check out the demo on youtube 👇

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKoKh5U9_XQ

For a more in-depth explanation of the project, check out the introductory article below 👇

Thanks.
7/28/21, 9:07 AM - Bayo: I tried solving the problem
7/28/21, 9:07 AM - Bayo: by building this
7/28/21, 9:09 AM - +232 99 783218: The contact form alone is ok, just add some sentence so that reviews can come in
7/28/21, 9:09 AM - +232 99 783218: Ok
7/28/21, 11:23 AM - Sai Teja: Anyone familiar with js
7/28/21, 11:23 AM - Sai Teja: I have a MCQ exam can anyone help

7/28/21, 11:32 AM - Williams: Good morning All.please, i need a concise explanation on the this keyword, return statement.
7/28/21, 11:35 AM - +234 902 396 6260: What do you need??
7/28/21, 11:39 AM - Sai Teja: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 11:56 AM - +234 902 396 6260: The "return" keyword either executes a statement or exit a function.
"This" refers to the object executing the c͟u͟r͟r͟e͟n͟t͟ function. So, without  any context, "this" refers to the global object which is the window. And it behaves differently in strict mode too.
7/28/21, 11:58 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Something like this

const test = {
  prop: 42,
  func: function() {
    return this.prop;
  },

will return 42, as this refers to the "test object".
7/28/21, 1:21 PM - Gold: Hey tech bros and tech sisters,
7/28/21, 1:23 PM - Gold: I built an open-source project for those who want to learn about Machine Learning. I will keep this simple, If you have any Knowledge at all of Machine Learning anything at all from knowing the right spelling of the word Machine Learning to have a good grasp of a newly introduced Model Architecture then you should know that there is someone out there who needs your expertise and it all boils down to a will you help the community or will you not. if yes then click on this link https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell_Machinelearning  if you have no knowledge of Machine Learning then please star the repository so others who are interested in it will see it. here is an article explaining everything about the project https://goldedem.hashnode.dev/everything-about-machine-learning-open-sourced

7/28/21, 5:36 PM - +232 99 783218: which type of Icon, fontawesome or an image/svg
7/28/21, 5:37 PM - +234 816 384 9474: Fontawesome

It's helpful though, that's if you are looking for remote jobs.
7/28/21, 9:33 PM - Gold: Ahh in essence @23299783218 to begin:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib/seaborn
Numpy
Tensorflow keras for deep neural networks
7/28/21, 9:33 PM - Gold: Should I write an article on that
7/28/21, 9:33 PM - Gold: Or should I add it to the repo
7/28/21, 9:33 PM - Gold: What do you guys think
7/28/21, 9:33 PM - Gold: Adding a "packages to install for ML"
7/28/21, 9:34 PM - +232 99 783218: I really don't like most of those😹 especially Matplotlib and Numpy

they are the ones that made me run away from Data Science
7/28/21, 9:34 PM - +232 99 783218: An article would be nice, and for future reference
7/28/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: Why did you run
7/28/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: Have you checked out the repo I posted
7/28/21, 9:38 PM - Gold: Okay I'll do that tommorow latest

7/29/21, 11:31 AM - Bayo: Hello Guys, 

So, yesterday I launch a product for an hackathon on *Hashnode*, and people seems to like it.

Check product demo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKoKh5U9_XQ

The product introductory article came out as top 1 on *Hashnode* and some registered users also upgraded their account to premium with their money, so we got a domain name.

*The introductory article*: https://unclebigbay.com/introducing-the-anonymous-feedback-platform-powered-by-the-chern-stack

I am actually sharing this to remind you that, it took me several years to actually start building what *makes small sense*, so do not be discouraged if you can't style a button yet, you're probably in your own several years too, don't be ashamed to share what you build, and moreover there is nothing like a perfect button 😉.

But what problem does this product solves actually? 🤷‍♂️

It is build to fill the gap between people who wants to receive feedbacks and people who wants to give feedbacks.

Let's see how this works.

Why not give me a feedback anonymously using my feedback link below 👇

anonymousfeedback.tk/to/unclebigbay

Below are tips on what you can give me a feedback on

1. My blog articles
2. Products. 
3. Myself as a whole
4. Behaviors

Feel free to send both positive, negative, and what ever feedback you observed.

*Good news is I won't even know you sent it.*

You can also create a link for yourself by signing up for an account anonymousfeedback.tk

*Note* if your feedback requires a reply, kindly drop a means of communication 🙏

If you see a typo in the repo then contribute and fix it.

It is our responsibility as a community.
 

Here is the link for the project:https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning

Here is an article explaining the project: https://goldedem.hashnode.dev/everything-about-machine-learning-open-sourced
7/29/21, 6:44 PM - Gold: Thanks brother
7/29/21, 6:44 PM - Emmanuel Dev: 🤜
7/29/21, 6:44 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Oh wow I'm flattered, I'm actually learning JavaScript myself so it would be nice to contribute to the community as I learn so sign me up🕺🏻🕺🏻
7/29/21, 6:47 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I've got links to JavaScript resources so I guess this will be a good opportunity to share them.
7/29/21, 6:53 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow, cool
7/29/21, 6:58 PM - +232 99 783218: What topics in mathematics do I really need to understand for machine learning??

I really want to learn it, but i have become poor at maths🤣
7/29/21, 7:00 PM - +232 99 783218: I saw thee topics, but most times people say Calculus is needed🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤔
7/29/21, 7:00 PM - Gold: Okay so eke is in
7/29/21, 7:00 PM - Gold: If you want to join the JavaScript group for learning please raise your hand 😅✊🏽✊🏽
7/29/21, 7:01 PM - Gold: Bro no maths is needed.
7/29/21, 7:01 PM - Gold: If you're willing I swear I'm the next 30 minutes I can help you and you will build a logistic Regression I swear
7/29/21, 7:01 PM - Gold: I'm fact you can build a neural network if you want

7/29/21, 7:04 PM - Gold: Sparrow is in
7/29/21, 7:04 PM - +232 99 783218: 😨😨😨wow, that is huge.

I have covered almost all the basics in Python, is that enough??

I only need to go over OOP to understand it more
7/29/21, 7:05 PM - Gold: Raise your hand if you want to be part of the JS group
7/29/21, 7:06 PM - Gold: It was back then that oop was important to understand ML.

Now most of the stuff in ML is done using open source libraries and the libraries take care of all the ML code
7/29/21, 7:06 PM - Gold: So do you want to build a model.

You even get python then there's nothing else stopping you
7/29/21, 7:07 PM - +232 99 783218: Ok awesome.

But Numpy and Matplotlib are used a lot in Data Science, and I really don't like Data Science🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
7/29/21, 7:07 PM - Gold: The most important paradigms sef for ML is logic paradigm
7/29/21, 7:07 PM - Gold: Machine Learning is not data science.

It is just a part of data science
7/29/21, 7:07 PM - +232 99 783218: I'm switching back to Python next year, because I would have completed all what I needed in the frontend
7/29/21, 7:08 PM - +232 99 783218: cool, I really don't like Data Science, but i like playing with data😹
7/29/21, 7:08 PM - +234 913 292 5682: 😱✋

7/29/21, 7:12 PM - +232 99 783218: Then by the year's end. I would be ready.

I only need to build few applications in the frontend _(blog app. E-Commerce, single user blog)_ then am going back to backend where I belong.

Good morning everyone
7/30/21, 7:38 AM - +234 909 602 6989: As a student?? Yes
7/30/21, 7:39 AM - +234 909 602 6989: It's hard learning js solo. I am using freecodecamp and i am still in the first course module since since Monday
7/30/21, 8:51 AM - +234 809 379 2855: Try using this course too; JavaScript Essentials Training, by Morten Rand Hendriksen. Its on linkedin learning
7/30/21, 8:53 AM - +234 909 602 6989: Alright
7/30/21, 12:48 PM - +234 808 809 0573: guys I have a JS assignment.
7/30/21, 12:49 PM - +234 808 809 0573: I've spent a lot of time on it but can't solve it, I'd appreciate some help
7/30/21, 12:52 PM - +234 808 809 0573: *You are developing an e-commerce application which allows users to add items to a virtual shopping cart. Once the user is done shopping, we will need to know the total amount of money to charge the user based on what was purchased.*

// The cart array stores all of the items selected in the shopping cart

let cart = [];

// The quantity array stores the quantity of the items in the cart.
// The cart and quantity arrays are connected based on the index i.e
// given cart = ["bread", "apple"] and quantity = [2, 1]
// we can tell that we have two pieces of bread and 1 apple.
// The item at index 0 in cart i.e cart[0] is "bread", so we get the quantity
// at the same index in the quantity array i.e quantity[0]

let quantity = [];

// The prices multidimensional array stores the prices of the items in the
// store. There are 6 items that can be purchased from the store:
// "bread", "apple", "noodles", "beef", "milk" and "coke".
// The price for "bread" is 20, the price for "apple" is 50 and so on.

const prices = [
  ["bread", 20],
  ["apple", 50],
  ["noodles", 100],
  ["beef", 40],

// Given an item, Complete the code to add the item to the cart and quantity
// arrays.
// Don't touch this section.
function addItemToCart(item) {
  // item is a variable that represents the item that is being added to the
  // cart. Valid items are items present in the prices array i.e "bread",
  // "apple", "noodles", "beef", "milk" and "coke".
  // An invalid item e.g "rice"  should throw an error ‘item not recognized’

  let isValidItem = false;
  // TODO(1): Write code to set isValidItem to true if item is present in the prices array

  // TODO(2): Throw error "item not recognized" if isValidItem !== true i.e false

  let foundItem = false;
  // TODO(3): Write code to check if item is in the cart array, and if so set
  // foundItem = true, and increase the quantity of the item by 1
  // Hint: Use the index where the item was found in the cart to increase the
  // quanity in the quantity array

  // TODO(4): Write code to add item to cart and set quantity to 1, if item is
  // was not found in the cart i.e foundItem is not true.
  // Hint: To set the quantity for the recently added item to 1,
  // do quantity.push(1)
}

// Write the code to calculate the total cost of all items in the cart based on
// the items in the cart and the quantity of the items purchased. The total
// cost should be stored in the total variable
// Don't touch the next line, we will cover functions later.
function getTotal() {

    // compute and set subtotal by multiplying the price and qty.
    // Hint: Each array in prices has the item at index 0, and the price at
    // index 1

    // TODO(8): Add subtotal to total (this should after the loop above)

// THIS IS FOR YOUR TESTING ONLY.

7/30/21, 2:28 PM - +91 88880 81365: Finished coding of 'Spense Landing Page' available on https://www.codewell.cc/

Very good challenge to practice flex layouts and positioning, fully mobile and tablet responsive.

...
]

it will be easy to loop through

Good evening geeks.
Please download and install the apk in the link above.
It's an app under development and it's used for debugging on android just like the developers console in computer browsers.

Use and give suggestions please.
Thanks for your time

8/3/21, 7:40 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Read it last night and one thing I find something outstanding was the honesty in the article. The explanations are concise, but sparse, too few words IMO. Nice to wanna make it a fast read but I believe a more elucidating and detailed article who bring a better ROI in the long run. Big ups tho, you did great.
8/3/21, 7:44 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝thanks.
didn't want to make it a long read, because I can get carried away easily😁😁

The estimated time is already 4 minutes.
I will try and make few touch ups to it today
8/3/21, 7:44 AM - +232 99 783218: which areas would you suggest need more explanation
8/3/21, 8:23 AM - Gold: This is nice sparrow.

But you  should talk more about your ideas, explore them more
8/3/21, 8:23 AM - Gold: But otherwise it's chill
8/3/21, 8:26 AM - +232 99 783218: This is not mine though
8/3/21, 8:57 AM - Gold: Oh
8/3/21, 8:58 AM - Gold: Sorry wrong reply.

You sent this also so I got confused 😅

8/3/21, 11:32 AM - +234 902 396 6260: If the cost of repair will get you a better laptop, buy a new one otherwise repair it.

8/3/21, 1:03 PM - Gold: Haha, I'm not a boss oh.


Just a guy trying to make a difference 😅😅
8/3/21, 1:05 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I may or may not have had help with that.
8/3/21, 1:05 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Aren't we all??
8/3/21, 1:18 PM - +232 99 783218: @2349023966260 what is the end goal of the project?? Apart from showing the hand washing images 

maybe a few insides will make me have extra ideas to add later😁
8/3/21, 1:19 PM - Gold: Haha
8/3/21, 1:19 PM - Gold: Haha I guess we are
8/3/21, 1:20 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I didn't have anything else in mind honestly. I just wanted to test out the reactive statement on something a little elaborate.
8/3/21, 1:21 PM - +232 99 783218: Ooohk, cool
8/3/21, 1:30 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm looking for a movie api tho, I want to build a Netflix-like app using svelte.

Are there any options to display my other html sub-pages (nav) without having to load them up with the */example.html?*

::: I don't want to use php. 

What I have is here (http://cornell.netlify.app)
8/3/21, 3:18 PM - +234 808 809 0573: <Media omitted>
8/3/21, 4:13 PM - +232 99 783218: I would love to work on this😁😁
8/3/21, 4:16 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'll let you know once I start.
8/3/21, 4:42 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝
8/3/21, 4:51 PM - +91 90823 40547: I want to build a banking system website..
With page, user, and transaction detail..

I don't know where to start...
Please guide
8/3/21, 4:55 PM - +91 90823 40547: I know HTML CSS PHP
8/3/21, 4:55 PM - +232 99 783218: what is your skill level??

have you found a design you want to use or do you already know how it should look like??
8/3/21, 4:56 PM - +91 90823 40547: I'm beginner...
I know HTML, CSS, PHP 
BUT I HAVEN'T MADE ANY PROJECT.. THIS WILL BE MY FIRST PROJECT..
I know how it should look like..
8/3/21, 4:57 PM - +232 99 783218: Hmmm. I would recommend you make something small first with HTML and CSS then make another one with HTML, CSS and PHP.

The small project will guide you to know what is possible to make and what is not
8/3/21, 4:58 PM - +91 90823 40547: I've made front end projects..
8/3/21, 4:58 PM - +91 90823 40547: But not with PHP
8/3/21, 4:58 PM - +232 99 783218: Your first project should not be a big project, it will get long and boring as you go because you will find that you have lots of gap
8/3/21, 4:59 PM - +232 99 783218: ok. Cool.

then I suggest do something simple with PHP.

Like a basic login system and a database type system.

Just the simple ones.
You will learn a lot with those two, trust me
8/3/21, 5:00 PM - +91 90823 40547: Yesss..
I've done several front-end projects and have good experience in front..
What I lack is backend..
8/3/21, 5:00 PM - +91 90823 40547: Okay.. I'll try to build login page..🤝🏻
8/3/21, 5:00 PM - +91 90823 40547: Thank you🤝🏻
8/3/21, 5:00 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝no worries
8/3/21, 5:01 PM - +232 99 783218: just something simple, like when the user logs in, display a successful message and maybe something else and then show the logout link
8/3/21, 5:02 PM - +232 99 783218: something simple as this, it will show you how to use Sessions, Authentication and some basic features you will use in any app
8/3/21, 5:03 PM - +91 90823 40547: That's great.. Will try to build these things🙌
8/3/21, 5:04 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝take your time bro, its a long journey
8/3/21, 5:04 PM - +91 90823 40547: Indeed..🙏🏼

8/3/21, 11:26 PM - +234 805 764 0156: Nice and perfect
8/3/21, 11:27 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm flattered sir.
8/3/21, 11:30 PM - +234 805 764 0156: It's actually a nice work
8/3/21, 11:36 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Brilliant
8/3/21, 11:37 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Thank you chief.
8/3/21, 11:40 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow, its cool but there are no downloads happening right??

and hopefully the mobile and tablet version will be easy to make🤣
8/3/21, 11:42 PM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm pretty sure it's the network or those downloads should be done now. 😂😂
I'll be working on the mobile version as I continue the Svelte learning. AMD I want to keep same design for the tablet version.
8/3/21, 11:43 PM - +232 99 783218: cool, the downloads could be done later, since it needs a more of a backend and since most of the data will be coming from an API
8/4/21, 9:17 AM - Eke: This is cool, though I think it could use more spacing between the boxes. Also the gradient progress bar color is not nice. Maybe try using a transparent background with a white progress bar.
8/4/21, 10:37 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Spaces and progress bar, noted. Thanks a lot chief.

8/4/21, 2:27 PM - +234 913 096 9252: What do you guys think. raenewsblog.netlify.app
8/4/21, 2:32 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The skill part, I think it should be git and not github.
8/4/21, 2:33 PM - +234 913 096 9252: Oh ok thanks
8/4/21, 2:34 PM - +1 (409) 944-5774: Beautiful but the resume link is not there. Awesome work.🙌🏽👍🏾
8/4/21, 2:35 PM - +234 913 096 9252: Still working on it
8/4/21, 2:35 PM - +1 (409) 944-5774: Aiit great 👍
8/4/21, 2:36 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Your resume is 🔥🔥🔥🔥. And the movie app, 😩😩, is dope.
8/4/21, 2:36 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Portfolio site, I mean.
8/4/21, 2:37 PM - +234 913 096 9252: Thanks still learning
8/4/21, 2:37 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Agreed, but you're 😱😨. Would you mind me DMing you?? I need help regarding somethings.
8/4/21, 2:38 PM - +234 913 096 9252: Really love this design and concept
8/4/21, 2:38 PM - +234 913 096 9252: Ok

8/4/21, 3:28 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Great website but it took long to load, try minifying it. And why use an IP address??
8/4/21, 3:38 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow bro. Which app did you use to make the design.

It looks awesome
8/4/21, 3:40 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool site, but the load time is too long,
8/4/21, 3:40 PM - +232 99 783218: and also, please put a name instead of IP address.

its much better that way
8/4/21, 3:41 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Gravit design.
8/4/21, 3:44 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool, is it free??
8/4/21, 3:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Freemium.
8/4/21, 3:46 PM - +232 99 783218: Ok, will take a look now, just hope its not web based
8/4/21, 3:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: It has a desktop app.
8/4/21, 3:48 PM - +232 99 783218: 😨😨😨, i didn't see a download link
8/4/21, 3:48 PM - +232 99 783218: but I will check again
8/4/21, 3:49 PM - +232 99 783218: I just saw the download will give it a try and see how it works

8/5/21, 10:12 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Hi guys. I've been stucked trying to set up a database using supabase. Supabase uses postgres. My problem is dis I want my user to able to edit their profile; and I want to set up another data where user can input his daily sales. I'm setting the later for rest API. 
Question: do I necessarily need to use different table for the profile and for the user daily sales.
8/5/21, 10:16 PM - +234 909 603 5283: Usually with supabase, you create a profile table and reference the auth.users table
8/5/21, 10:16 PM - +234 909 603 5283: You can also edit the auth.users table
8/5/21, 10:23 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Yeah. Editing the auth.user does not update the table. I'll have to write the code to insert it.
8/5/21, 10:24 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Well I don't have much experience with database though
8/5/21, 11:32 PM - Gold: Hey tech bros and tech sisters
8/5/21, 11:33 PM - Gold: I wrote an article about mobile app security for those of use who are app developers.


I spoke about MobSF as a mobile application security framework.

It works for iOS, android and Windows
8/5/21, 11:33 PM - Gold: Check it out herr

8/6/21, 1:20 AM - Gold: Thanks bro🔥🔥✊🏾✊🏾
8/6/21, 3:37 AM - +232 99 783218: Y not use firebase, since supbase is just the open source version of firebase
8/6/21, 3:55 AM - Emrys: Yes
Create a daily sales table that has a relationship to the users tablep
8/6/21, 3:56 AM - Emrys: Where each daily sales will map to a user
8/6/21, 10:09 AM - +234 811 429 7496: if you are learning JavaScript and have watched videos and till don't get it download Eloquent JavaScript
8/6/21, 10:09 AM - +234 811 429 7496: the book is helping my me
8/6/21, 10:09 AM - +234 811 429 7496: I recommend it
8/6/21, 10:10 AM - +234 811 429 7496: thanks @2348135816889
8/6/21, 10:22 AM - +234 913 292 5682: Yeah.... I did watch a lot of videos and I still didn't understand  javascript till I started reading the book. But honestly, I feel the videos I watched also played a huge role in actually understanding the book. Because even though I felt I wasn't understanding with the videos I watched, I feel there was some kind of subconscious knowledge passed in that aided me in fully understanding the book..... And sometimes I feel if I read that book when I was totally new to javascript, I probably wouldn't have gotten it.
8/6/21, 10:23 AM - +234 811 429 7496: yes true the knowledge from the video definitely helps understand the book faster
8/6/21, 10:23 AM - +234 811 429 7496: very correct 👍🏾
8/6/21, 10:25 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Share the pdf if you've got it please.

8/6/21, 5:39 PM - +234 817 131 5756: My thought exactly. My probs is how do i connect the tables? My thought is to use the User ID. I can add the user ID for each sales inputed by the User. So each sales would be identified by the user that inputed it.
8/6/21, 5:40 PM - Emrys: Yes
8/6/21, 5:40 PM - +234 817 131 5756: Trying something new.

8/6/21, 7:11 PM - +234 813 581 6889: You can also try *JavaScript and jQuery for interactive Frontend developers* by jon duckett
8/6/21, 7:13 PM - +234 813 581 6889: This one will teach you from the root/origin as a beginner with colourful background

8/6/21, 7:14 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Type it in Google.. I have it here with me but it is around 95+mb...
8/6/21, 7:22 PM - +234 806 490 1390: OK thanks
8/6/21, 8:17 PM - +232 99 783218: It's the only book I have completed and it is fire.

except that you have to end up skipping the JQuery part
8/6/21, 8:18 PM - +232 99 783218: check pdfdrive.net and get most of these books for free

8/7/21, 8:43 AM - +234 806 490 1390: Good morning from Nigeria everyone 🙂

I need help on this... I have a vpn  installed on my mobile phone. Anytime I switch the vpn on, I am unable to hot-spot internet to my PC. Like it blocks connectivity. But once I switch it off again,  I am now able to connect my PC to my phone's internet. 

The thing is I want to connect my PC to my phone's internet even when the vpn is on. 
Can someone teach me how to resolve this? Thanks
8/7/21, 8:50 AM - +234 812 073 4527: I had same issues one until I changed my phone
8/7/21, 8:51 AM - +234 806 490 1390: Oops!  So I'll need to change my phone? 😢
8/7/21, 8:54 AM - +234 812 073 4527: I'll suggest you try another vpn
8/7/21, 8:56 AM - +234 806 490 1390: I currently use windscribe
8/7/21, 8:57 AM - +234 806 490 1390: Which do you recommend?
8/7/21, 8:58 AM - +234 812 073 4527: Try protonVpn or 360
8/7/21, 8:58 AM - +234 806 490 1390: OK I'd check that out
8/7/21, 8:58 AM - +234 806 490 1390: Thanks
8/7/21, 9:05 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I use Windscribe too and I don't have this challenge.
8/7/21, 9:07 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I don't think the problem is from the VPN, check your phone's settings properly.
8/7/21, 9:11 AM - +91 88880 81365: I've just completed a front-end coding challenge from Frontend Mentor.

8/7/21, 3:16 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Thanks bro 🤜🏻🤛🏻
8/7/21, 4:14 PM - +232 99 783218: Cool one. I personally think the ToDo app has become a bit over used🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
8/7/21, 4:16 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Me too.. 

Thanks for the feedback bro 🙏🏻
8/7/21, 4:17 PM - +233 55 806 1770: It's necessary. It's a form of practice not to make a statement.
Other projects can be used for that.
8/7/21, 4:18 PM - +232 99 783218: U welcome, React looks nice
8/7/21, 4:19 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, but it seems a bit funny that you have to create it over and over for learning any new technology.

I did mine once with vanilla JavaScript and it got bored after I understood the DOM
8/7/21, 4:19 PM - +233 55 806 1770: So it helped you get somewhere, that's the whole point right.
8/7/21, 4:21 PM - +233 55 806 1770: In school, every class solves the same math problem from a teacher cos it helps them understand the topic and as a frame of reference.... Its just better than finding something new for everyone.
8/7/21, 4:21 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, it was the only application in mind that could really help me understand the DOM.

but my point is that it has become too rampant that most beginners just copy the code somewhere and put it in their projects
8/7/21, 4:21 PM - +233 55 806 1770: You have the liberty to invent your own stuff and ve creative, that's the whole idea of tech-Dev
8/7/21, 4:22 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Oh see, it worked for you lol
8/7/21, 4:22 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Well if you copy and paste, it doesn't really help anyone. On that day, you're gonna find your own self to blame.
8/7/21, 4:22 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, personally for me I feel like its not allowing me to grow and think about implementing the concepts in other projects
8/7/21, 4:22 PM - +232 99 783218: fact
8/7/21, 4:23 PM - +232 99 783218: 😁😁the moment was good, but I didn't end up completing the project, it just add and delete🤣🤣
8/7/21, 4:23 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Ah 🤣
8/7/21, 4:24 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Please do you guys have any app (in the form of games) that help you practice your skills?

8/7/21, 6:53 PM - +234 903 017 1730: Is css readily counted as part of HTML?

I mean, sometimes some people don't mention CSS as part of languages to learn, they believe you should learn it with HTML🤔.
8/7/21, 6:53 PM - +234 903 017 1730: Good evening👐
8/7/21, 7:06 PM - +234 814 414 9628: Good evening bro.

CSS is not part of HTML but  when someone is learning HTML, he would have to learn CSS too so that he would be able to style the HTML and make it look presentable.

My opinion
8/7/21, 8:46 PM - +232 99 783218: Because HTML on its own is just the structure and foundation.

CSS or JavaScript can be added externally or internally.

I would say they are all counted as part or HTML in some ways
8/7/21, 9:02 PM - +234 903 017 1730: Ok thanks
8/7/21, 9:56 PM - Gold: Wow this is awesome Georgie and the timer is a cool addition.


I don't think I've ever used a to do with a timer

8/8/21, 3:10 PM - +234 703 983 1390: As a developer…..it’s mandatory to be amongst those who share the same goals with you, those you can reach out to when stuck to avoid imposter syndrome and doubts

Once again….it’s a great privilege to be here with you all 🙇🏾
8/8/21, 3:11 PM - +92 315 7424060: Same here ✌️💙
8/8/21, 3:13 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I totally agree with you. This is one of the things I actually dish out. I talked about ways to handle imposter syndrome in one of my videos  here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wKMg2W5cApw&feature=youtu.be

I’m glad to be here. I love learning and sharing knowledge because no one is a fountain of knowledge. Indeed it’s a great privilege to be here with you all. Wishing everyone the best on their journey to the tech industry
8/8/21, 3:15 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: By the way, is there any other YouTube in the group? Just curious tho
8/8/21, 3:17 PM - +234 805 288 5385: I just subscribed to your channel
8/8/21, 3:18 PM - +234 703 983 1390: That’s a great video….I bookmarked it already 🌚
8/8/21, 3:19 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Thank you for the support. I look forward to making even better and educative contents for the dev community
8/8/21, 3:19 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Sounds good. I hope you get something valuable from it bro. 🙇🏽‍♂️👏🏽
8/8/21, 3:21 PM - +234 703 983 1390: I really need a lot of videos and articles on that at the moment

8/8/21, 3:24 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Imposter syndrome is not really a bad thing for a Junior developer. It’s just a stage at the career ladder. It’s very normal. Don’t beat yourself about it
8/8/21, 3:24 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Every Senior programmer today has gone thru it. It’s part of the profession, but don’t stay long in that stage.
8/8/21, 3:25 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: You’ll eventually find the balance and be confortable with your skills. Just be open minded and be willing to ask questions. If you watch that video, you’ll get a clue of my point. Hope it helps
8/8/21, 3:26 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Thanks for the support bro. I hope to bring better contents to support the dev community 🙇🏽‍♂️👏🏽
8/8/21, 3:32 PM - +232 99 783218: well i would say every programmer has gone through it.

The best thing is to just let it slide and make like you dont feel it around you
8/8/21, 3:34 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I agree with your point, also I would like to add that the imposter syndrome comes in the picture when a programmer is not confident in his/her skills. It’s take time to build confidence in this field especially when you are working in a team of experts, once you get to that point of having confidence in yourself, that’s when you overcome the imposter syndrome
8/8/21, 3:36 PM - +232 99 783218: I still have imposter syndrome when i see a complex code🤣

but i have learned to just ignore it and focus on building my skills more.

Complex projects mostly tells me what I am comfortable with and what I really need to learn.

8/8/21, 4:32 PM - Williams: Good having you here
8/8/21, 4:33 PM - Williams: Welcome man!
8/8/21, 4:41 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Is it okay to copy code eg from w3school.com how to ?
8/8/21, 4:42 PM - +234 812 128 6659: It is but it is not advisable..
8/8/21, 4:44 PM - +234 812 128 6659: You need get your hands dirty and code.

You can only be programmer, if you really want to be programmer.
8/8/21, 4:45 PM - +234 805 288 5385: I was thinking that's okay for beginners if they cant implement some stuff
8/8/21, 4:45 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Like to google for the solution
8/8/21, 4:46 PM - +234 805 288 5385: And use what they got online
8/8/21, 4:47 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s okay to Google for the sake of undestanding how other people implement their codes, but not the best for solving personal problems.
8/8/21, 4:47 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Remember if you give 10 programmers the same problem to solve, each one of them would have different approaches because everyone don’t code the same way
8/8/21, 4:47 PM - +234 812 128 6659: It is fine to Google the solution, always eager and understood why the code is working..
8/8/21, 4:48 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: But it’s cool to see how other people write their codes just to get more concepts. At the end of the day when you are on a job, you would have to provide a solution for your employer and you have to understand how code works before you can provide solutions
8/8/21, 4:48 PM - Rex Anthony: It is okay as long as you understand what the code does and how it fits into your project
8/8/21, 4:49 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Okay google the code, understand the code, implement it by yourself. Right ?
8/8/21, 4:51 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: 👍🏾
8/8/21, 4:56 PM - Rex Anthony: Absolutely 💯
8/8/21, 4:57 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Thanks guys

8/8/21, 5:58 PM - +91 88475 51243: I made 4 templates using HTML and CSS only, because I know javascript is going to be difficult because it would be the first programming language I would learn . That's I spent so much time on HTML and CSS
8/8/21, 5:58 PM - +91 88475 51243: What have you learned so far?

8/8/21, 6:45 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The thing is it's a nested array and the meetings are quite much. It tried this:

objects = JsON.parse(responseText);
for (var i in objects){
   console.log(object[i].value)
   console.log(object[i].value.value)
   console.log(object[i].value.value.value)
}
8/8/21, 6:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The first and second logging came back fine, but the third returned an error. And the issue is that the meetings are even still afryber than the third example.

8/9/21, 8:23 AM - Eke: What's the issue?. I'm sure there are quite a few persons that may have a solution to your problems
8/9/21, 8:25 AM - Temi: 🖐🏽
8/9/21, 8:50 AM - +91 97484 95951: I have some issues with my website.
One major part is the speed of the website.
I have tried many plugins but it is not improving.

Any suggestions would be very helpful.
8/9/21, 8:54 AM - Emrys: Are the sizes of your static files large
8/9/21, 8:54 AM - Emrys: such as js, CSS, font and images etc
8/9/21, 8:54 AM - +91 97484 95951: No, I have tried to keep as small. And use Optimole plugin for compressing the images
8/9/21, 8:55 AM - +91 97484 95951: But I don't know how to optimize after this.

I am struggling to do this in mobile devices.
8/9/21, 8:56 AM - Emrys: Is it hosted already
8/9/21, 8:57 AM - +91 97484 95951: Yeah, techhomie.com
8/9/21, 9:04 AM - Emrys: http://techhomie.com

Opened on my laptop

Made 91 requests.
All resources are 3.0mb
Took 48.59 seconds
8/9/21, 9:06 AM - Emrys: Try to measure it.

Then what platform are you using for hosting
8/9/21, 9:07 AM - +91 97484 95951: Bluehost.in
8/9/21, 9:26 AM - +232 99 783218: 😨😨😨that is extremely huge bro
8/9/21, 9:27 AM - +91 97484 95951: What?? the time it took?
8/9/21, 9:27 AM - +232 99 783218: Yeah
8/9/21, 9:29 AM - +91 97484 95951: Yeah, that's why I am asking for suggestions on what to do.
I have tried many things but it is not helping me.
8/9/21, 9:29 AM - +232 99 783218: hmmm, how many files are there??
8/9/21, 9:30 AM - +232 99 783218: you can try to compress the images, and remove unnecessary code in the scripts and CSS files.

also try to stop using too much external libraries
8/9/21, 9:31 AM - +91 97484 95951: Yeah, I have tried that.
Maybe there are too many plugins or caching plugins is not good.
It can be either reasons.
8/9/21, 9:32 AM - +232 99 783218: yeah too much plugins will cause load time
8/9/21, 9:32 AM - +91 97484 95951: Yeah, I will try optimizing
8/9/21, 9:42 AM - Temi: You should try deleting all inactive plugins too
8/9/21, 9:43 AM - Eke: Bluehost is 100% known to be slow for hosting WordPress websites. 

If you wanna test it, I can host your website on a free platform like Netlify so you know for sure, Bluehost is the issue.
8/9/21, 9:44 AM - +232 99 783218: If the site doesn't have any backend, the you should buy a domain and host it on netlify or github pages.
8/9/21, 9:44 AM - +232 99 783218: or even vercel
8/9/21, 9:45 AM - +91 97484 95951: OK, I will host it on other platforms and check...I also thought that Bluehost is the real issue for now
8/9/21, 9:45 AM - Eke: What he said. 👆🏽
8/9/21, 9:46 AM - +91 97484 95951: Oh ok

As web developers, we work with images on a daily basis and it will be very good if we understand their formats better so that we can use them better.

I have written this thread on image formats on Twitter.

8/9/21, 6:09 PM - +234 805 764 0156: It depends on what you want to wipe. Is it the data or what
8/9/21, 6:09 PM - +234 805 764 0156: You can only use bios to change hardware settings in which you must be very careful when you are doing it
8/9/21, 6:10 PM - +234 810 451 9681: Everything on the system @2348057640156
8/9/21, 6:13 PM - +234 805 764 0156: Then you need to use Windows 10 from a bootable disk to re-install the system and during the process you have option to format all the data

8/9/21, 8:00 PM - +234 705 937 4601: Hello everyone. Good evening

I’m a full-stack web-developer and a student of pharmacology. I joined this group through @2348105729893 and I’m very grateful. I started out coding in 2019. I learnt from YouTube and other online sources. I have one website under my belt lol. I decided to take a break and relearn from scratch cos I felt like I didn’t know enough. That first website was an eye opener for me. Now I’m learning from w3schools. I’d very much appreciate whatever tips offered. Thank you.
8/9/21, 8:02 PM - +233 27 597 9801: I’m also Daniel. Currently studying React and I know a bit of python lol. I’m a junior frontend dev
8/9/21, 8:06 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Welcome to the new members. Anyone with .Net stacks can always reach out to me for assistance. I’m working on a roadmap to C# and .Net Framework for complete beginners. Once I’m done with that, I might look into javascript as well. By the way I commend @2348105729893 for setting up this community of devs.
8/9/21, 8:13 PM - +234 907 585 9285: Thanks for adding me to the group @2348105729893

8/9/21, 9:07 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Sure, I’ll update the group when I have it all ready.
8/9/21, 9:08 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: .Net is a Microsoft Framework used for building all kinds of applications. Desktop, Web and mobile applications
8/9/21, 10:01 PM - +233 20 538 8601: Never used  c# after school
8/9/21, 10:03 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It is one of the most “in demand” skills after Java. Don’t forget as a developer, html,css and javascript are just the basics. When you get into the real world, you would need morethan those 3 to excel as a developer.
8/9/21, 10:03 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: But don’t get me wrong, it’s good to have a strong basics first which is the html css and JS
8/9/21, 10:04 PM - +234 813 207 2014: Thanks for saying this o, I was already thinking I was wasting my time doing JS
8/9/21, 10:05 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Along the line, I’ll also provide some SQL tutorials too. I’ll carry you guys along tho. It’ll be fun 😊

8/10/21, 9:28 AM - +232 99 783218: pertaining to law on the websites.

What is your take on websites not having *Terms of Service* and *Privacy Policy*

do you feel that every website should have at least one of these??
8/10/21, 9:29 AM - +234 907 585 9285: Thank you man. Let me take a look at it
8/10/21, 9:31 AM - +234 814 414 9628: 🙏🏻😊
8/10/21, 9:35 AM - +967 772 254 355: God brought you 🙂
8/10/21, 9:36 AM - +967 772 254 355: May I ask you something about law
8/10/21, 9:41 AM - +967 772 254 355: In private❤️
8/10/21, 9:44 AM - +234 811 719 4807: Every production website must have both.
The privacy policy typically states how users' data is handled and the terms of service states what you do on your website, the kinds of liability you might be responsible for and those you will absolutely not be responsible for.

Most countries require you to have both in order to legally operate a website but even if they weren't mandatory, every lawyer would advice you to have both as they can save from a lot of lawsuits and liability when the website eventually becomes popular
8/10/21, 9:44 AM - +234 811 719 4807: Shoot
8/10/21, 9:44 AM - +234 811 719 4807: Oh okay

8/10/21, 7:27 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: What are the benefits of using a pure Linux kernel (example mint) vs Windows Subsystem for Linux?
8/10/21, 7:28 PM - +91 75581 54440: How's the books is it good?
8/10/21, 7:49 PM - +1 (813) 613-3693: Sorry I haven’t read that one.
8/10/21, 8:04 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Major difference is that Linux has proven to be faster and produces better interfaces compared to windows. Linux mint is pretty much user friendly compared to previous Linux Operating systems
8/10/21, 8:04 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Other than that, both windows and Linux still have their own advantages.
8/10/21, 8:13 PM - +234 706 073 8426: How is interested in learning react js... lets learn together 🔥
8/10/21, 8:22 PM - +232 99 783218: You have already answer the question.

You wont get all the features and cool things with WSL
8/10/21, 8:22 PM - +232 99 783218: I have never tried it yet, and I don't play to use Node
8/10/21, 8:41 PM - +234 907 585 9285: I would like to change my OS to Ubuntu, please any body here with advice on whether I should or I shouldn't?? What's are it's pros and cons?
8/10/21, 8:50 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It depends on what you are trying to achieve with ubuntu. It can be complex, but if you know how to use it then that’s fine. It’s not just an OS you can have for fun, you have to learn how to use Ubuntu first before you switch to it. For example you should know how to use bash shell so you can troubleshoot and fix any issue that occurs.
8/10/21, 8:55 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Any Udemy User here
8/10/21, 9:00 PM - +234 907 585 9285: Alright. Learning to use the os might not be much of an issue. 
I work with Microsoft documents (excel/word files) a lot. Would I have something I can use to edit same documents in Ubuntu ?? Or can I install Microsoft packages in Ubuntu?
8/10/21, 9:05 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Well, the question is a generic one. What I’m curious about is…. Why do you want to switch to Ubuntu in the first place? Is there something windows can’t do that you think Ubuntu can do? And to your question, yes you can have excel and word files in Ubuntu
8/10/21, 9:06 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: In Ubuntu, You should be comfortable enough to use utilities like gimp, LibreOffice, telegram , Thunderbird which are similar to paint, ms office, outlook etc that you have in windows
8/10/21, 9:10 PM - +234 907 585 9285: From what I see online, I think it's faster than windows. And that's for programming generally it's a better option
8/10/21, 9:11 PM - +234 812 073 4527: I need free hosting and domain website please
8/10/21, 9:11 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Can anyone help
8/10/21, 9:11 PM - +232 99 783218: well it depends, if you like extreme customization then go for something else like Lubuntu or Kubuntu.

You can still do these in Ubuntu but too many steps required.
8/10/21, 9:12 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Yes like I told you here it is faster when you are running heavy applications and stuffs. But Linux is not as user friendly as windows so if you can really use Linux, then just go for it. I just wanted to makesure you have reasons in the first place.
8/10/21, 9:12 PM - +232 99 783218: I suggest you try out Ubuntu and then later test out other distros.

But you wont be able to run Adobe products in any Linux distro.

There are some work arounds but doesn't feel the same way
8/10/21, 9:13 PM - +232 99 783218: well no need for bash shell now if you don't plan on doing extremely deep dive.
8/10/21, 9:14 PM - +232 99 783218: You should download Virtual box and try Ubuntu there, and see if you like it.

Then make the switch
8/10/21, 9:15 PM - +232 99 783218: We have Libre Office but you can also use WPS Office since the looks feel much like MSOffice
8/10/21, 9:15 PM - +234 907 585 9285: Thank you so much for this 👍
8/10/21, 9:16 PM - +232 99 783218: Linux in general was made by developers for developers.

Windows was not, but they have the market share so they have tried their best to allow some developer experience
8/10/21, 9:16 PM - +234 907 585 9285: I would try the Virtual box for a while plus some tutorial vids on it before I make the switch
8/10/21, 9:16 PM - +232 99 783218: Netlify
Vercel
Github pages
Heroku

all free but for any serious domain name, you need to buy one
8/10/21, 9:16 PM - +233 20 538 8601: You should.  The cons- you won't get adobe suite and other softwares but for just programming , you will not regret it
8/10/21, 9:17 PM - +232 99 783218: Linux has become user friendly, but it depends on which distribution you choose.
8/10/21, 9:17 PM - +232 99 783218: https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-beginners/
8/10/21, 9:18 PM - +233 20 538 8601: Ubuntu and linux mint are good for beginners
8/10/21, 9:19 PM - +232 99 783218: personally Linux mint has been the best for me.

I tried Ubuntu and loved it until I met Linux Mint😎😎😊

never going back to Ubuntu
8/10/21, 9:20 PM - +234 907 585 9285: I appreciate 🙏

8/10/21, 9:21 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Thanks boss
8/10/21, 9:21 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Arch linux
8/10/21, 9:22 PM - +232 99 783218: not an advance programmer but I just like to learn about anything related to Technology.

Also I love to have freedom with my System and Linux gave me that
8/10/21, 9:22 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹😹😹he will just never call Linux again
8/10/21, 9:22 PM - +234 907 585 9285: Wow, thank you boss
8/10/21, 9:24 PM - +233 20 538 8601: Tell me more
8/10/21, 9:24 PM - +233 20 538 8601: I've been using ubuntu for 4 years
8/10/21, 9:25 PM - +234 805 288 5385: But its cool
8/10/21, 9:26 PM - +234 905 802 8858: Sir?
8/10/21, 11:48 PM - +232 99 783218: Wow,😮 October 4 will make me one year of using Linux Mint
8/10/21, 11:50 PM - +232 99 783218: Somethings are just out of the box with Linux Mint. (Synaptic, Tweaking the system)

And personally Linux Mint seems easy to navigate since its already like windows

Sometimes we want to secure our HTML page from unauthorized users.

But how do we do this in a very simple way without any *frameworks*??

Checkout this article to learn how you can protect your HTML pages with the JavaScript *window.location.assign()* method.

These will help you gain confidence and gather time for your next posts.

Meanwhile you can follow other people to see what they are posting and what people like and create content like them.

You can also follow Quora or other platforms where people asks questions so that you are never short on ideas.

8/11/21, 9:15 PM - +232 99 783218: Vanilla is just a term we use to describe as plain JavaScript or only JavaScript
8/11/21, 9:16 PM - +234 814 003 5918: ✅
8/11/21, 9:16 PM - +232 99 783218: In programming, Vanilla means *plain* or *just* 

that's my take on it
8/11/21, 9:17 PM - Williams: Yes just js
8/11/21, 9:17 PM - +232 99 783218: Without frameworks and libraries too.
8/11/21, 9:17 PM - Williams: I'm a beginner so the one that would be suitable
8/11/21, 9:17 PM - Williams: For now yes
8/11/21, 9:18 PM - +232 99 783218: none because JavaScript is just JavaScript.

the vanilla means that we  use JavaScript with framework, libraries or additional tools
8/11/21, 9:19 PM - Williams: Oya na pls send.. Thank you
8/11/21, 9:19 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝

8/11/21, 10:28 PM - Bayo: It is achievable

Just consistency and discipline
8/11/21, 10:28 PM - Bayo: Check for official Twitter header size on Google
8/11/21, 10:34 PM - Gold: Yeah bro
8/11/21, 10:34 PM - Gold: You can use Canva or adobe
8/11/21, 10:34 PM - Gold: They provide you with themes with the exact Twitter header size

8/11/21, 11:07 PM - Bayo: Come on
8/11/21, 11:07 PM - Bayo: Why do we still learn how to code when everyone else can ???
8/11/21, 11:08 PM - Bayo: Why they employ new teachers to teach when we have old teachers ???
8/11/21, 11:08 PM - Bayo: The difference between new writer and the old once are their voices
8/11/21, 11:08 PM - Bayo: Yes our *voices* are different
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: Your teaching style will totally be different from existing writers
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: And that might be what that *one* person needs to understand that concept
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: Just be yourself
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: Write in your own voice and aim (your audience )
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: And you will be fine
8/11/21, 11:09 PM - Bayo: That's all

*.md* files will be easy to share code snippets
8/12/21, 1:38 PM - Gold: To be honest I thought about it
8/12/21, 1:38 PM - Gold: I think I'll do that
8/12/21, 1:38 PM - Gold: But how is it better than.txt
8/12/21, 2:08 PM - +234 811 296 6298: U called Js  basic something, that can frustrate you.
8/12/21, 2:12 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Javascript is not a structured language, that’s why typescript is gradually taking over javascript in the industry, but we just can’t knock Js out like that. A lot of legacy systems are built on it. But in reality and compared to the technologies out there today, yes Javascript is basic. There is limit to what you can do with it.
8/12/21, 2:13 PM - +243 817 334 881: ✅✅
8/12/21, 2:15 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: The last time I used javascript was when I was a junior developer. As I climbed higher in my career, what we mostly use is typescript in this modern days, except for old systems that has been built on Js. Newly built systems don’t go for Js no more. It’s too messed up for modern programmers especially when there are options. Typescript is object oriented and easy to use. Guess what, typescript would automatically conver your code to javascripta for you without writing any line of javascript.
8/12/21, 2:16 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: But hey, it’s good for Junior devs to learn Js. It gives you the basics understanding.
8/12/21, 2:17 PM - +243 817 334 881: What about when it comes to DOM manipulation?
8/12/21, 2:17 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Typescript would take care of all of that.
8/12/21, 2:17 PM - +234 810 328 5879: Good day everyone, I bought a course on udemy (How to become a Shopify expert (From Zero to hero)). Please is this course enough for me to start freelancing? I also know Html, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript
8/12/21, 2:19 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: When you guys start working with frameworks, you’ll hit a better approach of inbuilt solutions that might seem complex now. Like I said, it’s still good to have a strong knowledge of Js tho. It’ll pay off in a long run, just don’t expect javascript to be the only thing you need to survive in the industry. That’s my point.
8/12/21, 2:23 PM - +243 817 334 881: I strongly agree! A basic strong foundation is very essential in this industry.
8/12/21, 2:23 PM - +234 904 757 9949 left
8/12/21, 2:25 PM - +232 99 783218: well personally, i like the formating more that .txt files.
8/12/21, 2:27 PM - +232 99 783218: HTML, CSS and JavaScript are enough to start freelancing.

honestly learning a CMS is good also but not many will recommend that as a developer.


Learn it to get quick cash and less time to build
8/12/21, 3:05 PM - Gold: I guess you're right and it would make more sense if the content just appeared as you clicked.

I'll change it.
Or will you do that?
8/12/21, 4:03 PM - +232 99 783218: ok will do it
8/12/21, 4:04 PM - +232 99 783218: or you can do it both ways, those that don't know Markdown will write in .txt files.
8/12/21, 4:05 PM - Gold: Hmm
8/12/21, 4:05 PM - Gold: Okay that makes sense
8/12/21, 4:05 PM - Gold: Do that
8/12/21, 4:05 PM - +232 99 783218: because I wanted to share some Git snippets i was compiling but they are in markdown

they just makes everything cool and the dont is awesome to read.

8/12/21, 4:46 PM - +91 85400 64287: I am doing animation to an element using  "transform: translateY" but the element is shifting from its original position in X direction as well
8/12/21, 4:46 PM - +91 85400 64287: Not able to figure this out
8/12/21, 4:47 PM - +91 85400 64287: I am learning programming and thisis is my first CSS project
8/12/21, 4:48 PM - +232 99 783218: Is there any way you can take a photo of the code and maybe a video of the output🤔

8/12/21, 4:55 PM - +232 99 783218: you know the *Y* brings everything down or goes up.

so you cant get a center with just *Y*
8/12/21, 4:55 PM - +232 99 783218: try removing the *Y* so it would be *translate(...)*
8/12/21, 4:59 PM - Eke: What do you want to achieve with the animation? Knowing this will help to find a solution to your issue
8/12/21, 4:59 PM - +232 99 783218: I think he wants the text to be centered.

I have no idea why, because it is centered already
8/12/21, 5:02 PM - +91 85400 64287: I have already centered the text as u can see in the beginning of video.
8/12/21, 5:03 PM - +91 85400 64287: Text doesn't look good na if it is at bottom right. It shd be center no
8/12/21, 5:04 PM - +91 85400 64287: Yes that what.  I am wondering why animation is shifting it
8/12/21, 5:05 PM - +232 99 783218: because its animation😌😌

it is suppose to animate
8/12/21, 5:06 PM - +91 85400 64287: Haha yeah😄 but I haven't instructed the animation to shift to undesired location
8/12/21, 5:06 PM - +91 85400 64287: See the video again
8/12/21, 5:06 PM - Eke: Adding the transform: translateY property will align any element you target.
8/12/21, 5:06 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹welcome to CSS🤣😹

its a rebel style language
8/12/21, 5:07 PM - Eke: To the top or bottom
8/12/21, 5:07 PM - Eke: Just like @23299783218 is saying. Make sure you're not targeting the text too on the animation style.
8/12/21, 5:11 PM - +91 85400 64287: Haha😄

8/13/21, 9:05 AM - Emrys: My story.

When I started programming I learnt Java but it felt useless after months because I had no real use of it. Then I decided to move on to html, CSS, Js then after some months it felt useless cause I wasn't good in designing but my JavaScript is dope so I was able to build some games  but I have no colour combination skill im bad at it.
Then I moved on to python and started using it for backend, and I found what I love and kept doing It so I built my first blog from scratch where user can post stuffs and subscribed users can receive mail when an admin posts and an admin validates a users post. Then I was happy. Then I moved to learning what's behind a computer that makes it work so I learnt a lot of things. Then I moved to C/C++ and started working with microcontrollers and digital electronics programming Arduino ands other controllers units I simulated them because I had no money for the kits. Then I worked with Kotlin, with my previously learned java and built android and windows apps.

The main purpose of this my story is that I still felt useless but @2347066985640 always got my back.

When I built my final year project which was a WiFi controlled surveillance vehicle I now found the usefulness of all the skills I've learnt.

I programmed the esp32 with c/c++ which runs a server and delivers a webpage I wrote in html/CSS/JavaScript to a connected device which can be accessed via an IP address.
I created an android app to control the car, then a python script for control via command line.

No knowledge is wasted.
Keep learning geeks.

8/13/21, 9:24 AM - Gold: Damn.


Thanks bro
8/13/21, 9:24 AM - Gold: You're one talented developer
8/13/21, 9:25 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Thanks boss,really appreciate this
In how many years did you learn all these?🤔
8/13/21, 9:37 AM - +232 99 783218: Awwww, nice story.

I learned Java and it helped me learn other languages (Python and JavaScript) quickly and well.

I still owe many thanks to Java😁
8/13/21, 9:44 AM - +254 720 814519: Relatable 🤪 I'm learning Java and anytime I try to look at any other language magic happens I really can understand what's happening...but I'm a little confused since I'm already done with HTML and CSS... so I'm worried of getting to something else before I do some practice projects. Kind of am I headed for the same direction or something? some advice please fellow devs 🙆🏾‍♂️
8/13/21, 9:48 AM - +232 99 783218: 😁😁I think Java is a great language to struggle with, everything else just seems easier to grasp.

I have never really watched a JavaScript tutorial or read the books much but I can still build many things using it
8/13/21, 9:49 AM - +254 720 814519: Oh, I'm getting that right 😁 so it's still fine if I get deeper with java as I'm doing before I get to other languages?
8/13/21, 9:51 AM - +232 99 783218: You could learn the basics of Java and it will apply to almost every language.

or you could also go deeper and be backend developer or Android developer with Java
8/13/21, 9:54 AM - +254 720 814519: That's noted thank you... It's really a pleasure having response from a fellow Dev who's been in the same process 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
8/13/21, 10:00 AM - +232 99 783218: U welcome bro.
the journey is not easy
8/13/21, 10:26 AM - Eke: Wow. What a story. You've learnt quite a lot in just a short time. That's great. 💯💫 And yes @2347066985640 is a great guy.

8/13/21, 11:53 AM - Eke: You're alone ooo. 😅
8/13/21, 11:54 AM - Emrys: I started 2019
8/13/21, 11:54 AM - Eke: Just turn it off. Or set home network to metered connection
8/13/21, 11:56 AM - Gold: Haha why na
8/13/21, 11:57 AM - Gold: Omo I never planned to update.

I was running a local server and it was slow, so I decided to restart my system and then the thing now caught me
8/13/21, 11:58 AM - Emrys: Sorry
8/13/21, 11:59 AM - Gold: <Media omitted>

8/13/21, 12:03 PM - Gold: Haha, I won't lie Sha I want to just use windows 11 and I want someone to suffer with me I'm case it fails 😅
8/13/21, 12:03 PM - Eke: Chai... I feel yah.
8/13/21, 12:03 PM - Gold: Haha you have no idea how good he really is
8/13/21, 12:03 PM - Eke: Let's just say I'm waiting for their 4th update. At least from there
8/13/21, 12:04 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹😹😹

8/13/21, 7:08 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Then you shouldn't have spacing problems. Try resetting the window properties like this:
*{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
Then include breakpoints in your containers.
8/13/21, 8:39 PM - +254 791 039068: Ok bro ..correction is route to perfection👍

8/13/21, 8:41 PM - +254 791 039068: Happy for the compliments🤸‍♂️😁
8/13/21, 8:45 PM - +234 817 131 5756: I guess I'll have to get the userid when making the request but I do I tell the database to return only the data that match the user id i added

8/14/21, 12:59 AM - +234 811 735 2301: Hi so I have a question, as a frontend developer are languages like Python, Java ,php and C++ necessary to learn?
8/14/21, 1:22 AM - +232 99 783218: Nope, but if you learn them its a bonus
8/14/21, 1:58 AM - +91 88475 51243: If you learn c++ or java and then data structures and algorithms , you will become great developer and then you can easily crack interview of mnc
8/14/21, 7:00 AM - +234 805 288 5385: You’re never going to know how to do everything (nobody does), and you’re always going to need to look things up on the internet (everyone does). Don’t let that stop you from just diving in and building stuff.

Good morning!
8/14/21, 7:03 AM - +91 82981 42213: https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1426419395618910209?s=08
8/14/21, 7:15 AM - Eke: PHP and python is popular in the frontend space.
8/14/21, 7:20 AM - +91 85400 64287: Hi all, the course which I am taking for web dev is starting with bootstrap after HTML,CSS
8/14/21, 7:21 AM - +91 85400 64287: Should I learn the bootstrap , will it be beneficial or should I skip it
8/14/21, 7:21 AM - +91 85400 64287: ?
8/14/21, 7:21 AM - +91 85400 64287: Or is there anything better than bootstrap that I should learn
8/14/21, 7:21 AM - +91 85400 64287: Pls guide me
8/14/21, 7:30 AM - Eke: There's tailwind too. All a CSS frameworks. But the main thing is do you understand proper CSS? If you can build a few projects with proper CSS then you could learn a CSS framework if you want.
8/14/21, 7:32 AM - +234 805 288 5385: Dont learn bootstrap
8/14/21, 7:34 AM - +234 814 003 5918: I skipped mine. I like pure css
8/14/21, 7:34 AM - +234 814 003 5918: But css frameworks save time so that you can focus on more important thing
8/14/21, 7:35 AM - Eke: It's not compulsory. You can do without learning it. But since it's very easy to learn, I'll say learn them both. Tailwind and Bootstrap. Because if you're doing web development, you will someday encounter client projects written in these frameworks.
8/14/21, 10:21 AM - +232 99 783218: Naah PHP is going down bro its JavaScript (Nodejs) and Python (Django) taking the top now
8/14/21, 10:23 AM - +232 99 783218: It is beneficial when you have a very large project or want to have style quickly in any project.

Personally I don't like frameworks because they can bring code that you won't use and that will slow down site performance
8/14/21, 10:25 AM - +232 99 783218: Since they are all CSS I went and learn CSS deeper and now I dont need them.

but if you want a CSS only framework *Bulma.io* is the best out there.

_disclaimer:_ bulma only uses Flexbox for everything.
It works but you will have more divs to create
8/14/21, 10:37 AM - Eke: I said that cos those we're the languages he mentioned. Yes JavaScript is dominating frontend. But PHP dominates the freelance world. I don't see it going down anytime soon. ◉‿◉
8/14/21, 10:42 AM - Eke: Me too. I prefer plain CSS. But as I said, you might encounter it in a client's or company's project. As for Bulma, I'm not a fan of using flexbox for layouts. 😅 So I'll pass on that.
8/14/21, 10:55 AM - +232 99 783218: Yeah PHP is kinda the king of freelancing because of WordPress and similar sites😹

but when it comes to manual building, people always go for JavaScript and Python
8/14/21, 10:55 AM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹 Flexbox is very hard for layouts🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ that was why I stopped using Bulma,
8/14/21, 11:08 AM - Eke: Eggzatly. 💯
8/14/21, 11:11 AM - Eke: Honestly. 😅 But flexbox is best for aligning contents IMHO
8/14/21, 11:14 AM - +232 99 783218: yeah, that's the use nowadays😹

I hardly use Grid except for specific things
8/14/21, 11:21 AM - +91 85400 64287: Lot of suggestions, thanks all. Currently I am week in grid and flexbox. I made a project without them. So I think first I need to learn those two and then I may think of bootstrap
8/14/21, 11:22 AM - +91 85400 64287: *week--------> weak
8/14/21, 11:22 AM - Eke: Hmm.. Grid is the source of my confidence in CSS.
8/14/21, 11:23 AM - +234 808 475 2572: personally though
I think you should learn grid before bootstrap
8/14/21, 11:26 AM - Eke: I agree.
8/14/21, 11:30 AM - +232 99 783218: start with Flexbox since its more easy to learn than grid.

and after doing the basics, checkout FlexboxFroggy website for practice challenges
8/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 85400 64287: Yes thanks a lot!!
8/14/21, 11:40 AM - Eke: 💯
8/14/21, 12:35 PM - +234 813 207 2014: 💪🏽💪🏽

8/14/21, 5:40 PM - +234 812 073 4527: No

8/14/21, 5:41 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Nice
8/14/21, 5:41 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Have you heard of media query in css? Try to work with that and then transition to bootstrap ✌🏾
8/14/21, 5:41 PM - +234 812 073 4527: I used bootstrap
8/14/21, 5:41 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Thanks bro
8/14/21, 5:42 PM - Eke: This is sick! 💯💯💯

8/14/21, 5:43 PM - +234 806 433 1592: How do you half fill the background with color?
8/14/21, 5:43 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 💪🏾
8/14/21, 5:45 PM - +234 812 073 4527: I set a particular width and height for a class then use psuedo ::befor me to set background
8/14/21, 5:45 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Lemme share you the code with you
8/14/21, 5:46 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Nice!! I like how you did it. But suppose you need a more complex shape, what do you do??
8/14/21, 5:53 PM - +234 812 073 4527: Hmm!!!
8/14/21, 5:56 PM - +234 806 433 1592: Okay thanks I will appreciate that

8/14/21, 8:18 PM - +234 813 207 2014: Please can someone please explain recursion to me like I'm 2 years old
8/14/21, 8:19 PM - +234 813 207 2014: I used please twice
8/14/21, 8:20 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I explained recursion here
https://youtu.be/w_PoTGnEI2Y
8/14/21, 8:21 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s a process of having a method or function call itself
8/14/21, 8:22 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Feel free to reach out to me if you still have doubts from my explanation in that video and I’ll set a session with you to break it down
8/14/21, 8:33 PM - +234 813 207 2014: Ooh thanks is it the same as in JS?
8/14/21, 8:33 PM - +234 813 207 2014: Thanks boss
8/14/21, 8:35 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Yes! Recursion is a concept. You can use any lbgiage to excute the concept
8/14/21, 8:35 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: language*
8/14/21, 8:39 PM - +234 811 735 2301: Wow this is pretty cool, I like how you did the half-image, half-background

8/14/21, 9:27 PM - +234 813 207 2014: Heyy me too
8/14/21, 9:29 PM - Eke: I strongly suggest you use the same name in all your platforms. People will recognise you faster and you never know where that might take you. 🌚
8/14/21, 9:29 PM - Eke: Just my 2 cents
8/14/21, 9:32 PM - +234 811 735 2301: I usually do, but they said to use a unique username
8/14/21, 9:33 PM - +234 902 396 6260: That's why I was able to spot you quickly.
8/14/21, 9:33 PM - Eke: Ohh.... True.
8/14/21, 9:33 PM - Eke: Eggzatly.

8/15/21, 7:39 AM - +234 810 328 5879: I've learnt html, CSS and I'm presently taking Jona Schmedtman Javascript course on Udemy (70% done). But I feel I still don't know CSS at all 🤦🏽‍♂️, please can anyone recommend any great(few hours) CSS course that could help sharpen my CSS skills again. Thank you
8/15/21, 7:39 AM - +234 814 003 5918: He has css course
8/15/21, 7:40 AM - +232 99 783218: The best way to learn and understand anything is to build things in it.

That's the only way you will feel that you are comfortable.
8/15/21, 7:40 AM - +234 814 003 5918: True o
8/15/21, 7:40 AM - +232 99 783218: If you are learning Flexbox, make sure you build something crazy using 80% - 90% Flexbox.
8/15/21, 7:46 AM - +234 810 328 5879: I checked it out. He was using SASS, its a very lengthy course, I feel if I should leave JavaScript and go back to take CSS I might forget JS 🤦🏽‍♂️
8/15/21, 7:48 AM - +234 814 003 5918: You can’t be learning without practice. In a week of learning , you should set out days for practicing also , that will help you strengthen your skills
8/15/21, 7:48 AM - +232 99 783218: Then I suggest, you learn both since you already started JavaScript.

Or you can do what I did.
Learn Flexbox and Grid then go back to learn JavaScript
8/15/21, 7:50 AM - +234 810 328 5879: Oh alright, you mean from Jonas CSS course? Please where can I learn to master flex and grid?
8/15/21, 7:50 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Sass is actually very simple and straightforward

Learnt it in two hours from w3schools and one YouTube tutorial
8/15/21, 7:50 AM - +234 814 003 5918: He covered both css and sass
8/15/21, 7:50 AM - +234 803 974 7164: Go to freecodecamp.org search the courses they uploaded you will get your hands on flex and grid
8/15/21, 7:51 AM - +234 810 328 5879: I think he used SASS all through. He only started with a little CSS
8/15/21, 7:52 AM - +234 810 328 5879: Alright. I'll check em out. Thanks
8/15/21, 7:52 AM - +234 814 003 5918: But learning it is an added advantage
8/15/21, 7:52 AM - +232 99 783218: FreeCodeCamp is one, but I mostly use books.

You can learn CSS from

8/16/21, 2:45 AM - +232 99 783218: the best thing, is to generate one and save it in a file, the copy and use it as the password.

The copying part is boring always
8/16/21, 2:53 AM - Gold: Like bro
8/16/21, 2:53 AM - Gold: I just saved it using GitHub
8/16/21, 2:53 AM - Gold: Like I don't need to sign up Everytime I commit now

8/16/21, 1:52 PM - +234 811 735 2301: But isn’t it stressful having a password
8/16/21, 1:56 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I think it is but I guess I wouldn't want just anyone to be able to make changes and push without my permission so It may be useful(if someone else has easy access to my laptop)
8/16/21, 1:57 PM - +234 811 735 2301: True

8/17/21, 3:12 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Angular is not dying. Infact it is more powerful than react and the others. React is just a javascript library. Angular is a full framework that not only accommodates javascript, but also uses ES6 to transpile typescript into javascript.
8/17/21, 3:13 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s okay if you don’t know how to use angular or typescript or not comfortable with it, but saying that it is dying is an insult to the professional dev community. React needs to catch up tho

8/17/21, 3:16 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s really not complicated, you might want to start learning typescript and it would make your life easier when dealing with angular. Why should you even want to write javascript in an angular framework. If you know how to use angular, you’ll understand that the framework itself would write your javascript code for you. But you gotta know how to use it first. The first step is by learning typescript. #TheSeniorDev

8/17/21, 3:16 PM - Bayo: Uhmmm
8/17/21, 3:18 PM - Bayo: I can write one for you personally

Just tell me what you want to understand

And it will be done 💯

8/17/21, 3:41 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Everything about map(). And thanks a lot.
8/17/21, 4:02 PM - +232 99 783218: Hmmm, 🤔🤔 please educate me.

I only said that because people (newbies) are choosing these three instead of Angular
8/17/21, 4:04 PM - +232 99 783218: Hmmm, 🤔I know its is full fledged but yet still its too much for a little project and has some problems with major updates in the past
8/17/21, 4:06 PM - +232 99 783218: I would love to know this too and also add filter()
8/17/21, 4:24 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I am not in anyway downplaying your opinion tho. I was just pointing out the fact that Angular is not dying. It’ll be hard to explain how powerful Angular can be when the developers involved haven’t started writing typescript. Like you said, the “people(newbies)” are choosing react because javascript is more of a basic language to learn when you are walking the programming path. As the “people(newbies)” advances in their programming journey, they would discover better and easier ways to execute projects without going thru the stress of javascript. JS is not a structured language, it doesn’t support modules neither does it support interfaces. The solution to all those problems has been implemented on typescript which is the new scripting language in the enterprise environment. There’s no point going back and forth in this topic if the people
Involved are not into typescript. It’s okay to take it one step at a time…. I think people should start looking into typescript because it’s easier to learn and write than JS and angular would automatically convert your typescript to JS at run time. Hope that makes sense.
8/17/21, 4:24 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Like all libraries and frameworks, there is always an update. Angular 12 is the latest version right now. It’s getting better with time 😊

8/18/21, 9:16 AM - +91 85400 64287: Pls tell me how shd be my learning curve, like I have learned HTML and CSS and currently on the bootstrap. In what order shd I learn javascript, angular, typescript, etc?
8/18/21, 9:25 AM - +232 99 783218: naah, start with Javascript since its easy.

Typescript is like the big brother of JavaScript.

Angular is still JavaScript or Typescript, just that it makes writing JavaScript or Typescript easy and has done many work for u
8/18/21, 9:27 AM - Eke: Create a new user.

8/18/21, 10:57 AM - +91 85400 64287: And after javascript whicch one shd I take first ?
8/18/21, 11:00 AM - +232 99 783218: I would suggest trying all and see which one you think is easy.

But for the job market React is leading
8/18/21, 11:02 AM - +234 813 581 6889: You don't have to memorize all bro..

If you are good with CSS..

You just have to learn the bootstrap grid and flex-box and also cards thats all, vanilla CSS will take care of padding, margins and the rest..

My opinion though
8/18/21, 11:12 AM - +234 811 735 2301: You don’t really have to memorize it, once you start using , it would be like reflex
8/18/21, 11:14 AM - +234 805 288 5385: Why memorize? When you have the documentation
8/18/21, 11:14 AM - +234 805 288 5385: With coding don't memorize anything use the documentation
8/18/21, 11:16 AM - +234 814 003 5918: You dont memorize code, you just understand it and know that it exist, so when you get to a point you need such code you remember it and refer to it, as you code  more and more it sticks to your memory
8/18/21, 11:16 AM - +234 806 490 1390: You don't need to memorize. Just try to get familiar with the classes and how to use them in tour projects. You can always refer to the documents in future projects .

8/18/21, 12:27 PM - +91 85400 64287: Yes it helps. Thanks a lot
8/18/21, 12:49 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Just like @23299783218 said. You should start with learning JavaScript since you are already learning html and css. Typescript is an object oriented language. If you had started your learning in an OOP language then typescript would have been super easy. Don’t worry about typescript for now. I’ll recommend you perfect your learning span with html css and javascript for now and you can look into object oriented programming later on.
8/18/21, 12:51 PM - +91 85400 64287: I know C++ and have some idea of how classes works. Will that help me?
8/18/21, 12:53 PM - +232 99 783218: it could help when the time reaches, but if start with typescript you will struggle a bit compared to when u start with Javascript
8/18/21, 12:54 PM - +91 85400 64287: Yes thanks
8/18/21, 12:55 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: If you are good with c++ then learning typescript would be easy,  but it takes a while to get there. Horn your skills with javascript first and build a couple websites and then you can try frameworks.

2. Push your code to github.
3. Go to your netlify dashboard and click "new site from git"
4. When you get to where it ask for the base directory, the base direct is the folder where your index.html file is. If you didn't put it in a folder, leave it blank.
5. If you don't know what the build is leave it, it will automatically get it.
6. Click on deploy site and what for it to deploy.

8/20/21, 1:59 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Scrimba is a really cool platform for learning, am I the only one who got an email from them about the massive  discount on their front end development career path course?
8/20/21, 2:07 PM - +44 7912 346974: Do you have the link?
8/20/21, 8:33 PM - +234 806 863 7325: How much does it cost??
8/20/21, 8:33 PM - +234 708 567 7723: How are you doing
8/20/21, 8:34 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Great
8/20/21, 8:34 PM - +234 806 863 7325: What's this on??
8/20/21, 8:49 PM - +234 812 077 2330: It was a deal that expired in a day https://bit.ly/3sBmjz1
8/20/21, 8:49 PM - +234 812 077 2330: 20k for 6 months access
8/20/21, 8:51 PM - +44 7912 346974: Thank you for this. 

I think I can learn what I need in 1's subscription.

Need a js refresher (doing the free one)

and a reactjs one.

1 month should be perfect, so I'll stick to the normal subscription, then cancel.
8/20/21, 8:53 PM - +234 812 077 2330: You're welcome
8/20/21, 8:55 PM - +44 7912 346974: Remember guys, they'll always be discounts for stuff.

First pick what you want to learn and plan out time to learn it.

When you are close to finishing, then think about what you want to learn next.

You don't have unlimited time and also it's a waste buying loads of courses you'll never do.

Lastly don't get stuck in doing courses, in real life you have to think on your own, plan, debug, and learn to ask for help and know how to Google the answers. 

These are very important skills courses will never team you.

8/23/21, 10:07 AM - +234 812 077 2330: Have you ever been in a situation where the mobile view of the website is fine on dev tools but comes out broken on the actual device? What did you do?
8/23/21, 10:11 AM - +232 99 783218: Yep, and it was horrible and got me scared and pissed at my self
8/23/21, 10:14 AM - +234 812 077 2330: That's where I am right now and I just don't get it
8/23/21, 10:14 AM - +232 99 783218: well try to fix the exact place that gives you problem on mobile
8/23/21, 10:15 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Did you set meta = viewport??
8/23/21, 10:19 AM - +232 99 783218: yeah I always do.
and it has become standard now in many text editor shortcuts
8/23/21, 10:22 AM - +234 812 077 2330: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> Am I missing something?
8/23/21, 10:22 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Sweet...
8/23/21, 10:22 AM - +234 806 863 7325: No
8/23/21, 10:23 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Ok.. Which text editor you using??
8/23/21, 10:24 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Because of your CSS file.  Why its broke is... Because you didnt set the pixel view length for each device.... I mean.. How it should be viewed by different devices... Ranging from phones to tablet and systems
8/23/21, 10:28 AM - +232 99 783218: Yeah I think so
8/23/21, 10:29 AM - +232 99 783218: I think this was what's missing.

If you haven't learn Media Queries yet, then you need to
8/23/21, 10:39 AM - +234 812 077 2330: vs code
8/23/21, 10:39 AM - +234 812 077 2330: how do I do this?
8/23/21, 10:40 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Its a tiny part of js.... Where you input media queries
8/23/21, 10:40 AM - +234 806 863 7325: For min pixel length on how you want your website to be viewed... That's the only part you need..
8/23/21, 10:41 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Ok... To get that point... Go on youtube.. Download... HTML and CSS crash course full tutorial... You'll see it there
8/23/21, 11:58 AM - Eke: Yes. This always happens. This usually happens on device with screen width of 300px, you'll have to target the smallest width on your media query. If you're using the Dev tools switch to mobile mode and select Samsung galaxy S5. If your website looks good on this screen, it'll look good on every other screen.
8/23/21, 11:59 AM - Eke: You can still check all the available devices. Like iPhone 6/6s/7/8 screen size.
8/23/21, 12:54 PM - +91 76490 78546: Hello 
I want become a web developer  please suggest full course
8/23/21, 12:58 PM - +234 806 863 7325: You have to know HTML full course.. CSS full course... And any other language... Maybe JavaScript or python
8/23/21, 12:59 PM - +91 76490 78546: Ok
8/23/21, 1:00 PM - +232 99 783218: Iphones are the best to check for

8/23/21, 2:20 PM - Eke: Traversy HTML CSS course on YouTube is a great way to start. If you have a couple of bucks, you could get his full course on Udemy. HTML, CSS from the beginning including SASS

8/23/21, 3:02 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Html and css by jonas schmedtmann then advance css and sass by jonas schmedtmann highly recommended

8/23/21, 11:58 PM - +232 99 783218: 😁😁I recently found out that they are not common again.

Most navigation are now close to the center
8/24/21, 9:40 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Hi guys
I'm having a problem with media query.
How do you decide which breakpoints to use for your media queries.
8/24/21, 9:40 AM - +91 82981 42213: Same here
8/24/21, 9:41 AM - +234 813 207 2014: <Media omitted>
8/24/21, 9:41 AM - +234 813 207 2014: Those are the measurements in pixels
8/24/21, 9:41 AM - +234 813 850 5782: <Media omitted>
8/24/21, 9:42 AM - +234 813 850 5782: I think the best way is try enlarging the viewport and see where it breaks, then tackle that point.

That's how I do it most times
8/24/21, 9:52 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Alright thanks bosses
8/24/21, 9:53 AM - +234 808 475 2572: But there's a way to use dev tools to check for the sizes?
8/24/21, 10:01 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Hi everyone

Any ReactJs developer looking to add to his portfolio here. Some friends of mine want to create an international money transfer application like ChipperCash. It is a portfolio project but it could also be sold if its successful.

Please send a dm if you're interested. 2 ReactJs devs are needed
8/24/21, 10:54 AM - +232 99 783218: most times I just use the most popular ones or somewhere closer to them.

400px
576px
768px
992px
1200px
8/24/21, 11:05 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Thanks boss
8/24/21, 11:13 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝🤝
8/24/21, 3:35 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Media queries can get tricky sometimes that's why alot of people use bootstrap to keep media queries minimal. But I'd say you can open whatismyviewport.com in one tab and then slowly resize your window while looking to see what breaks on your website, take note of the viewport at that time and write your media queries to it. Most browsers like Chrome have built-in indicators when you inspect your site so you can use that too
8/24/21, 4:41 PM - +234 808 475 2572: Thank you very much 
I would checkout and use the site
8/24/21, 5:55 PM - Eke: Cool site. Thanks for sharing.

8/26/21, 6:19 AM - +234 903 330 6120: Hello house
Good morning.
Pls I need a little help.

So I just completed my SIWES at a radio station and was asked to build a web app that'll be useful for them.
The problem here is that I have no idea of what I can build.
Pls does anyone have an idea??
Thank you ☺️.
8/26/21, 6:38 AM - +232 99 783218: Hmmm, the task they gave you is vague.

ask them for more details on what specifically they want and make sure its within your skills
8/26/21, 6:40 AM - +234 903 330 6120: No more details were provided.
All they want is a web app that the radio station would be able to use.
8/26/21, 6:48 AM - +91 75581 54440: Suhail Bro ❤️.vcf (file attached)
8/26/21, 6:48 AM - +91 75581 54440: Add this number
8/26/21, 7:02 AM - +232 99 783218: Hmmm, that will be hard for you to do because it contains many possible things to do.
8/26/21, 7:05 AM - +232 99 783218: A web app means you need some kind of dynamic site but at the same time you don't need it depending on what they want.

Also it can be a website, but without specific details, you will have to use your creativity to make one and put all the details there.

Later they can say then don't like the design or maybe they want to add something else.😹🤣

but in all simplicity, search for radio station website designs and take inspiration from the designs
8/26/21, 7:06 AM - +232 99 783218: maybe you can even blend multiple designs in yours and have a project to hit them with😌.

Kudos... and goodluck
8/26/21, 7:06 AM - +234 903 330 6120: 😂
Honestly I just have to make something that'll work. It doesn't have to have any amazing design.

Thank you 😊
8/26/21, 7:20 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Simple
8/26/21, 7:33 AM - +232 99 783218: just do your best, and make sure you don't overwork your self.

also fight the temptation of adding cool stuff in too🤣😹😹
8/26/21, 7:34 AM - +232 99 783218: In reality websites design doesn't really matter much, its the content.

so make sure the content stands out and make it easily readable
8/26/21, 7:38 AM - +234 806 863 7325: 👊🏼
8/26/21, 8:26 AM - +234 903 330 6120: 😂😂
I can't even add any cool stuff because the deadline is too close for that
8/26/21, 8:27 AM - +234 903 330 6120: Thank you boss🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️

8/26/21, 9:43 AM - +234 811 735 2301: How about a web app that curates playlists that people can listen to or news
8/26/21, 10:09 AM - +233 55 806 1770: I have a question devs
8/26/21, 10:09 AM - +233 55 806 1770: Let's say you design the layout for a blog, do you copy and paste the code for every new post you wanna put on?
8/26/21, 10:10 AM - +233 55 806 1770: I don't know if you get what I'm trying to say
8/26/21, 10:28 AM - +232 99 783218: you can build a login system and add some libraries for the WYSIWYG editors.

or you can write the blog on paper and they design them to fit the site later
8/26/21, 10:28 AM - +232 99 783218: depends on which way u want it
8/26/21, 10:30 AM - +233 55 806 1770: I see

8/26/21, 10:37 AM - +232 99 783218: ok then go for the second option.

8/26/21, 1:37 PM - +234 812 128 6659: A quick tip: if you are new to software engineering to Jump into frameworks. 

Be kind and  honesty to yourself to be proficient with JavaScript before learning React and others. 

Be warned.🧯
8/26/21, 2:12 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Oh nice
8/26/21, 2:59 PM - +234 905 802 8858: you gerrit
8/26/21, 3:23 PM - +234 805 288 5385: I don't agree with this advice
8/26/21, 3:23 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Some persons can learn both at thesame time
8/26/21, 3:24 PM - +232 99 783218: Its rare, but possible.

but its hard to just jump to learning React or others without even knowing what javascript does
8/26/21, 3:25 PM - +91 88475 51243: In my opinion too it's better to learn javascript first efficiently then go for react .
8/26/21, 3:26 PM - +91 88475 51243: Imagine to learn react and javascript on same day . It will take double time and in both you might not give your full potential.
8/26/21, 3:27 PM - +234 812 128 6659: Thank you.
8/26/21, 3:27 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Yeah but after learning the basics without going deep you can start learning framework they are meant to simplify our work
8/26/21, 3:29 PM - +234 812 128 6659: If I may ask how do you measure BASIC in JavaScript?
8/26/21, 3:34 PM - +234 812 128 6659: There is huge difference btw in knowing the basics and mastering it.

There is no shortcut on this field than practice, practice and fall in love with the process.
8/26/21, 3:42 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah just the major basics like the DOM and they learn both simultaneously
8/26/21, 4:25 PM - +91 76490 78546: send the live website link, as asked in the assignment.
8/26/21, 4:25 PM - +91 76490 78546: Anyone make? Please help me
8/26/21, 4:25 PM - +91 76490 78546: Or give me any idea
8/26/21, 5:00 PM - +91 85400 64287: Which assignment?
8/26/21, 5:38 PM - +234 805 288 5385: The best way is to learn as needed.
8/26/21, 5:39 PM - +234 805 288 5385: For example You are building a project and you need to join two array together and you don't know how to do that. Then google for 'How to join to arrays together"
8/26/21, 5:40 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Definately you would come across spread or concat method then learn and apply it
8/26/21, 5:44 PM - Eke: Spck editor is cool too.
8/26/21, 5:48 PM - Eke: True.
8/26/21, 5:49 PM - Eke: Probably host your assignment and send the link.
8/26/21, 9:36 PM - +234 813 581 6889: I remembered when i was in school and I was told to write some phrases in an higher Education note(from top to the bottom) whenever i did something bad..   sentence/phrases like  *"I will not do that again"*.  Assuming I understood JavaScript then I would not have wasted my time writing .... I will have just use the *for loop*..

8/27/21, 3:34 AM - Bayo: High Five Everyone ✋,

I am having my second final paper this morning by 9:30am, but I couldn't sleep 😪, so I decided to do what I like the most 💃.

Probably writing 🤷‍♂️

The topic that came to my mind is the JavaScript Sort Method.

The *sort() method* is an essential method to be understood by every JavaScript developer, either in the front or back end stack.

In this article, I explained the *principles* of the JavaScript Sort method with *use-cases* and *real tasks*

I believe I couldn't sleep because someone needed this explanation.

I hope you find it helpful 🙏.

See you in the article: https://unclebigbay.com/javascript-sort-method-principles-use-cases-and-tasks



🔊 A big announcement is also coming very soon on my next open source project built with the *HERNA* STACK. 

*Stay Tuned*
8/27/21, 5:38 AM - +91 99968 05784: Can anyone tell me what is the use of section when we have div element?

8/27/21, 7:10 AM - +232 99 783218: The main technical difference IMO is that section is semantic (easier to know what it means)
8/27/21, 7:24 AM - +91 99968 05784: 🆗
8/27/21, 7:26 AM - +234 708 567 7723: Good morning guys

8/29/21, 2:28 AM - Gold: Hey guys
8/29/21, 2:29 AM - Gold: I wrote an article on everything you need to know about the Tesla Robot, what it is, why it was built and why it doesn't make sense.

Here's the link to it: https://goldedem.hashnode.dev/the-tesla-robot-in-a-nutshell
8/29/21, 2:29 AM - Gold: Check it out
8/29/21, 2:29 AM - Gold: And tell me what you think
8/29/21, 2:29 AM - Gold: About the Tesla robot
8/29/21, 6:23 AM - +234 810 015 0152: it makes sense
it's a general purpose robot that will perform unsafe,repititive and boring tasks... it was probably built that way(human-like) because of engineering decisions and aesthetics and probably to make the user feel more comfortable and at ease when around it
8/29/21, 6:25 AM - +234 810 015 0152: could be useful for old people especially if it's coded to be able to perform basic first aid and get help incase of emergencies
8/29/21, 6:31 AM - +234 810 015 0152: also it's probably going to put a lot of people out of work if it works well and goes mainstream. A lot of people survive by doing repititive and boring work
8/29/21, 8:23 AM - Gold: It could be trained with Elon's neural link software
8/29/21, 8:23 AM - Gold: Sorry AI
8/29/21, 8:24 AM - Gold: Haha, well it'll be a while before that happens
8/29/21, 8:24 AM - Gold: This is just innovation

8/30/21, 3:25 PM - +232 99 783218: Now to the project.

I think you should increase the down vote limit to 10.

people will always bash others advice no matter what or how good it is.


on the advice form, I would suggest you change *Git Push* to *Share Advice*.

since some guys will be beginners and not even know about Git and GitHub or someone may want to share advice but they are not really a dev in some sense

9/1/21, 9:46 AM - Bayo: 🔥
9/1/21, 11:44 PM - Gold: Advise for developers especially those in NIGERIA.  

Please always invest in your tools that is the reason why they are paying you well. This our job is not as fun as it seems so don't make it tiring for yourself. Get that headset or subscribe for that Netflix, Dezeer etc, buy that PS5 that is always on your mind these things are work tools. Any thing to get your mind settled is a work tool. You need that sharp brain to do what you do.

Always have a spare Laptop, the idea of my system crashed doesn't make you look professional.

Have multiple source of internet connection (One broadband like Smile or Spectranet and one regular 4g internet like MTN or Airtel. please never use glo). This case is mostly important for those working remote especially foreign jobs cause when you give Nigerian developers a bad name you block doors for other developers that are struggling to get a foreign job too.

Power source should be made available, If u are well to do get an inverter, else get a gen. the cheapest is to get a UPS for as low as 30k and is capable of powering your laptop and your internet for like 6 to 7 hours.

Pay for premium softwares when needed. Add it to your clients bill and make sure you buy them. It saves you from embarrassment and time.

When you can, outsource jobs that are time consuming and doesn't bring money so you can have more time to your self, you are busy is not a good reason to wear dirty cloths and unkept hair.

Always take care of your mental wellbeing by taking time off to go out on kayaking, tours, movies, regular strolls etc. Just go out and interact with people. Also fashion out time for gym so your belly wont look like mine.

Buy that thing you have always had eye for and save your brain the extra stress. Bank will always use that money you are saving to do pompori.

Try and cover your camera webcam cause trust me someone might be watching.

Always make out time to call your family and friends especially your spouse/boo cause trust me depression is real and those are the people you will need when you are in that state.
9/1/21, 11:46 PM - +234 907 777 1659: This is dope! Thanks Bro
9/1/21, 11:47 PM - Gold: We have to help each other as much as we can bro

I used https://rickandmortyapi.com API to fetch the characters.

Used Axios library to fetch the data form the URL. which automatically transforms the data in JSON foemat.

9/2/21, 7:08 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Been studying Javascript for sometime now and always wondered how Javascript is linked with the Html/css doc elements.

Learnt the basics DOM today from (traversy) and Man that was refreshing.
9/2/21, 7:08 PM - Segun: Ok. Thanks anyway
9/2/21, 7:08 PM - Segun: 👍👍
9/2/21, 7:09 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹cool one.
at least you didn't struggle much (yet)

9/2/21, 7:10 PM - Segun: Nice one 🙌🙌
9/2/21, 7:11 PM - +234 703 983 1390: Hello 👋🏾 
Good evening…..it’s been quite awhile in here
9/2/21, 7:11 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Hahaha.... Its should be said that the dom is how you link your js to your html instead of meantioning all the stuff about manipulation making it sound like it's something different
9/2/21, 7:11 PM - +233 55 806 1770: I think bit will help a lot of people
9/2/21, 7:11 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Chalebit wasn't easy
9/2/21, 7:12 PM - +233 55 806 1770: I'm still struggling with the scope of var and let 🤦🏼‍♂️
9/2/21, 7:13 PM - +234 813 581 6889: Great🔥🔥🔥
9/2/21, 7:24 PM - +234 805 288 5385: What about *this* keyword
9/2/21, 7:25 PM - +234 703 983 1390: That’s even more confusing 😒😒😤
9/2/21, 7:26 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Lol
9/2/21, 7:26 PM - +234 805 288 5385: I was struggling with it b4
9/2/21, 7:29 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah that would be the simplest term, but still people will get it confused
9/2/21, 7:29 PM - +232 99 783218: Just avoid using var😹😹 I did it and now I mostly just use *const* and few times i use *let*
9/2/21, 7:33 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Always use conts if you need to mutate the variable then change it to let
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s simple and it depends on what you are trying to achieve. var is your best bet if you want to declare a variable that can be used anywhere inside the function or the class. let is more like a private access modifier. Whatever variable you declared with let can only be used inside of the block you declared it. You can’t use it outside of that block
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah that was what changed my mind, and I also found out that most of the variables I use are not changing
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +234 806 863 7325: This is a problem you'll never encounter using python... You'll just name your variable and that's it
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Seriously??? Do you know the difference between var and let and constant and why you need them?
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Lol
9/2/21, 7:34 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹 that's why I have return back to Python
9/2/21, 7:35 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Whatever you declare with Const can’t be changed. The variable becomes a constant value

9/2/21, 7:37 PM - +234 806 863 7325: When I saw the issue with JavaScript.. I just hang  on to my python... Jeje
9/2/21, 7:37 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s really not about returning to python or any other language. It’ a about understanding the concept of programming.
9/2/21, 7:37 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹
9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +234 806 863 7325: I do.. A lot... With python
9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Learn Object oriented programming
9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Var is hoisted, function scope

9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Yup
9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +234 806 863 7325: I have... I know it better with python
9/2/21, 7:38 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, I really didn't leave Python.

I just decided to learn some frontend because I didn't want to wait on any frontend dev in the future.

Now I'm returning back to backend to grow more and improve
9/2/21, 7:39 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: 👏🏽👏🏽
9/2/21, 7:39 PM - +232 99 783218: Try it in Java and enjoy crying
9/2/21, 7:40 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Python can... Do almost anything... So why do bit by bit... When I can have a compatible one 😉😉
9/2/21, 7:40 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Well.. Stress free.. Is why I didnt even bother with java
9/2/21, 7:41 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Lol. Y’all cracking me up 😂😂
9/2/21, 7:42 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Java is mad... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
9/2/21, 7:42 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Anyone that uses Java to learn programming would end up finding other languages easy
9/2/21, 7:43 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I started with C then to C++, pho and then Java
9/2/21, 7:43 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: After knowing Java to the point of building full functional projects, then no language has been intimidating to me again
9/2/21, 7:43 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Well.. Yeah.. The truth... Just like who learned driving using manual gear system.. Would find automatic really easy..
9/2/21, 7:43 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: I code c# Java typescript anything
9/2/21, 7:43 PM - +234 812 128 6659: Has anyone ever heard of brainfuck?
9/2/21, 7:44 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: It’s an obsolete programming language

9/2/21, 7:45 PM - +234 806 863 7325: No wonder

9/2/21, 7:52 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹I learned OOP in Java and i still got issues with it.

But I still owe many knowledge to Java, it has really helped me understand the other languages easily
9/2/21, 7:52 PM - +232 99 783218: 🤝🤝kudos to Java😎😎
9/2/21, 7:52 PM - +234 806 863 7325: My point exactly
9/2/21, 7:53 PM - +232 99 783218: The most difficult language😹😹

The name really fit it
9/2/21, 7:54 PM - +234 812 128 6659: It fucks with your entire brain recursively.😫😂
9/2/21, 7:56 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹🤣🤣I saw the hello world syntax and I nearly cried🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

It was a hell.
there was another one too that only consists of whitespaces😹😹
9/2/21, 7:56 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Its because most modern programming languages has solved a lot of issues with the older languages. Older languages don’t have libraries, so programmers had to build everything from scratch, but these days we have libraries and frame works

9/2/21, 7:58 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Machines are made to make reality easy.. So if they end up creating languages that's hard
. what's the point
9/2/21, 7:59 PM - +232 99 783218: yeah, but its better now
9/2/21, 8:00 PM - +232 99 783218: At least even machine learning is easy now because you don't need much maths
9/2/21, 8:02 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Even if I'll do... No problem
9/2/21, 8:02 PM - +234 806 863 7325: But if the syntax to print "hello world " is crazy... Imagine building a machine using such language
9/2/21, 8:02 PM - +232 99 783218: yep, many algorithms are available now.

I was scared at first but I watched at a tutorial today and it got me more interested

9/2/21, 8:58 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: Block means {…}
9/2/21, 8:59 PM - +1 (317) 756-7593: When you open a Curley brace { 


and close a Curley brace}
9/2/21, 9:00 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Ahhh so within the curly brackets eh

9/2/21, 9:22 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Actually.. Nothing is given freely... Those wishing to work remotely earned the circumstances to be like that.. Besides.. Programming takes brain work and most dont know how to use it
9/2/21, 9:23 PM - +234 814 003 5918: For real mean it requires a lot of hardworking
9/2/21, 9:23 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Simple....

9/3/21, 9:42 AM - Eke: Java was my first language too. Though didn't do much with it.
9/3/21, 10:38 AM - +91 88475 51243: If you learn data structures and algorithms in java then it is useful .
9/3/21, 1:00 PM - +232 99 783218: 😹😹😹😹
9/3/21, 1:02 PM - +232 99 783218: I never really learned JavaScript basics.

I just learned the syntax and the differences then I went for DOM
9/3/21, 1:04 PM - +91 88475 51243: I am talking about java. However , everybody have their own preference .

But for long run I think it is crucial to do data structures and algorithms because it improves our problem solving ability and to write effecient code.
9/3/21, 1:05 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah I know, I was implying that after I learned Java, JavaScript became somewhat easy for me to just grasp.
9/3/21, 1:06 PM - +232 99 783218: Even though I hardly used heavy and complex algorithms in projects.
9/3/21, 1:06 PM - +233 55 806 1770: guys i got the JS scope topic. thanks y'all
9/3/21, 1:09 PM - +91 88475 51243: Ok . I think ds and algo are important for just to pass interview of big company.  In real life as you said we rarely use it .

9/3/21, 1:12 PM - +233 55 806 1770: do you guys know of any website that gives you challenges to help you practice JS  ?Something like from start to finish.
9/3/21, 1:12 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah the only ones we end up using most are List(arrays) and dictionaries (objects, map).
9/3/21, 1:12 PM - +232 99 783218: Codewars.com or exercism.org
9/3/21, 1:13 PM - +233 55 806 1770: starts with declaring variables to array manipulation to objects and so on ?
9/3/21, 1:13 PM - +233 55 806 1770: SPARORO ma guy , thanks bruv.
9/3/21, 1:13 PM - +232 99 783218: nope, the challenges varies, you can choose what you want to solve, easy, medium or hard
9/3/21, 1:14 PM - +232 99 783218: but the hard one you solve increases your point to next stage
9/3/21, 1:14 PM - +233 55 806 1770: oh okay , i think i get it .

9/3/21, 8:31 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Yes.... By mike(giraffe academy)  and Nelson (amigoscode)
9/3/21, 8:37 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I'm getting to find out that learning Javascript and I guess any other programming language, is more about problem solving and learning to think like a problem solver than just knowing their syntax.

So far, not gonna lie, It's not been so easy, but I remember that this is how I felt when I was learning html and css( maybe the feeling is more intense). But this is it, I've burnt my boat, there is no turning back, I'm sticking to it ✊🏽
9/3/21, 8:39 PM - +234 902 396 6260: 💪🏾
9/3/21, 8:47 PM - +233 55 806 1770: Small small
9/3/21, 8:54 PM - +232 99 783218: Yep it's just about solving problems.

The syntax gets unnecessary after the basics
9/3/21, 9:05 PM - +234 812 077 2330: 👍🏻

9/4/21, 9:36 AM - +234 903 330 6120: Yup.
9/4/21, 9:36 AM - +234 903 330 6120: Im a writer boss
9/4/21, 9:53 AM - +234 816 988 6335: Hello, someone should pls explain the “spread Operator” in JavaScript for me
9/4/21, 9:53 AM - +234 816 988 6335: Something like this [...array]
9/4/21, 9:55 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Actually, if you have an array content which you want to copy all of its content into another array or you want to log all of its content 
You can use it
9/4/21, 9:56 AM - +234 808 475 2572: For example 
arr1 =[1,2,3,4]
arr2 = [...arr1]
9/4/21, 9:56 AM - +234 808 475 2572: This will copy all of arr1's content to 2
9/4/21, 9:57 AM - +234 808 475 2572: You can use it for functions too
They call it rest parameter
9/4/21, 9:57 AM - +234 808 475 2572: You can use mdn for reference too though
9/4/21, 10:05 AM - +234 816 988 6335: Thanks a lot.. I get the spread operator now can u throw more light on the rest operator in ur own terms possibly with a take home example
9/4/21, 10:05 AM - +234 805 288 5385: Way to spread iterable
9/4/21, 10:09 AM - +234 805 288 5385: Can be use to 

Merge 2 or more Array [...array1, ...array2] 

Clone Array [...array] 

Convert String → Array [...'string'] 

Convert Set → Array [...new Set([1,2,3])]

Convert  Node List → Array [...nodeList]
9/4/21, 10:12 AM - +234 805 288 5385: Rest is the opposite of spread
9/4/21, 10:12 AM - +234 808 475 2572: 🙌🏻🙌🏻
9/4/21, 11:37 AM - +234 816 988 6335: Thanks a lot guys

9/4/21, 12:12 PM - +91 99968 05784: Yes i know but i want to know the reason
9/4/21, 12:12 PM - +91 99968 05784: Why it happened
9/4/21, 12:13 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Because by default anchor tags are inline   element
9/4/21, 12:13 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Because anchor tags are inline elements.
9/4/21, 12:13 PM - +91 99968 05784: Ok bro
9/4/21, 12:14 PM - +91 99968 05784: Thx🙂
9/4/21, 12:14 PM - +234 805 288 5385: Most people use 
<ul>
  <li><a>Home</a></li>
</ul>
9/4/21, 12:14 PM - +234 902 396 6260: If you wanted them to display as list you could use "ul" or just manipulate them with CSS.
9/4/21, 12:15 PM - +234 805 288 5385: You can also use flex box then change the flex direction
9/4/21, 12:27 PM - +91 99968 05784: Ok buddy👍
9/4/21, 12:44 PM - +232 99 783218: because anchor tags are inline by default.
you can use CSS to change them to block elements
9/4/21, 12:45 PM - +232 99 783218: That has become the standard now😁

I just hope something else will come soon
9/4/21, 12:45 PM - +91 99968 05784: Yes okay thx🙂
9/4/21, 12:52 PM - +234 805 288 5385: I use flex box for navigation i am not using ul again
9/4/21, 12:57 PM - +232 99 783218: I use Flexbox too but the ul is just for the structure
9/4/21, 12:58 PM - +234 812 077 2330: hey guys, I got an email from turing.com to recommend 3 software engineers for US remote jobs, if youre interested you can DM me your email address.

The difference between arguments and parameters in javascript.

Arguments are always outside functions

9/7/21, 1:14 AM - +232 99 783218: I think JS will win.

I haven't give it a test yet though

9/8/21, 4:16 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Hello here, I need clarification on something...

Can python and JavaScript be used independently to perform same tasks..
9/8/21, 6:33 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Okay.. Can you provide a use case example?
9/8/21, 6:40 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Like creating a chat bot ..
I learnt that python can achieve that..
Can JavaScript also do same
9/8/21, 6:40 AM - +234 814 414 9628: Yes.. I think so
9/8/21, 6:42 AM - +234 814 414 9628: I think chat bots are about setting up a webhook to watch for user interaction then send an appropriate response once the user input is validated
9/8/21, 6:44 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Ok..
9/8/21, 6:44 AM - +234 813 581 6889: Thanks for this...🤝🏿
9/8/21, 6:44 AM - +234 814 414 9628: You're welcome 🤝🏻
9/8/21, 7:01 AM - +232 99 783218: Yes, but it depends on the task too.

They both have strength in one or more areas.

Before you go to bed,

Lemme tell you a short story,

9/10/21, 10:21 AM - +92 313 8167414: I got a pretty interesting question from one of my friends. Although I have replied to him to the best of my knowledge but would like to hear your thoughts too.

Question is:

'I have some textual records. What would be the more appropriate way to store it in a SQL DB. Should I store the text in DB or shall I store text in files and then use text files in the DB'.

What do you think would be a good approach?

9/10/21, 12:38 PM - +91 88880 81365: Developed a small ReactJs project . As I am the fan of remarkable TV Show Breaking Bad, I thought making project would be nice. I found this API https://www.breakingbadapi.com/ which provides all the information about the characters.

Honed my reactjs skills in this project using hooks and animation library which is built for reactjs 'Framer-motion' and also used the ' react-intersection-observer ' package to perform animation while scrolling.

9/10/21, 12:45 PM - Gold: It's awesome bro 🔥
9/10/21, 12:45 PM - Gold: How about adding a background for the characters
9/10/21, 1:48 PM - +232 99 783218: I think storing the text in a DB is more convenient, since you can add to it without much strain.

If you store the file, you would have to upload the file everytime is there was a change. (and Imagine the file got to Gigabytes of data)🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️

9/11/21, 7:33 AM - +234 902 396 6260: It's working. Align-items works for the x-axis and everything is centered horizontally like this u less you want something else.
9/11/21, 7:36 AM - +91 99968 05784: No it is used to center vertically
9/11/21, 7:36 AM - +234 902 396 6260: That is if you used "flex-direction: column".
9/11/21, 7:36 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Put that in your code and see.
9/11/21, 7:48 AM - +234 813 850 5782: If u want align items to work u need to give the parent a height

Do something like min-height:100vh
9/11/21, 7:48 AM - +91 99968 05784: Ok i will try
9/11/21, 8:37 AM - +232 99 783218: Hey you

I've spoken to so many students recently who feel like they’ll NEVER get this coding thing.

Frustrated.

Feeling like an imposter.

They're watching all of the coding tutorials...

doing classes, courses…

but nothing is quite hitting the mark.

I get it.

I've been there too - time and time again - and the ultimate solution? 

It's always to just sit down and code...

Put your head down and actually start coding. 

You're not gonna become better by watching tutorials or listening to people.

It’s just gonna fuck you up.

Get in the dirt and start digging instead.

Code.

From scratch... by yourself. 

Make plenty of mistakes.

Spend hours and hours solving a problem.

Screw it up completely and start again. 

The point is to just keep going.

Build some momentum. 

That is where the real growth happens. 

And if you're comparing yourself to others, thinking they have some magic "secret" and you're behind? 

If temporarily someone is "beating you?"

That’s fine.

But YOU are never gonna get better if you’re not coding.

And nothing will push you to grow more than a bit of competition... if you actually put in the work.

9/14/21, 6:11 PM - +234 814 775 1998: Actually Java is easier. I love python but Java is just more robust
9/14/21, 6:46 PM - +234 806 863 7325: So you're saying java is easier than python??
9/14/21, 6:49 PM - +234 810 618 9445: Hello house, good evening🙏🏾
Please I need help creating a simple website. I'm having issues with ideas, can anyone help? I'll really appreciate a response, thank you.
9/14/21, 6:54 PM - +234 811 735 2301: You can check frontend mentor for challenges
9/14/21, 6:54 PM - +234 810 618 9445: Thank you very much
9/14/21, 7:41 PM - +232 99 783218: Yeah, its the best language (high level) to learn a hard concept.

Once you understand it, then any language will be easier
9/14/21, 7:42 PM - +232 99 783218: Well it depends on many factors.

I would choose Python for the simplicity, quick building or apps and good code principles.

But Java for learning and understanding concepts

9/14/21, 8:21 PM - +234 814 775 1998: It's easier to grasp basic programming concept with Java compered to Python.
Especially OOP concepts.
9/14/21, 8:23 PM - +234 814 775 1998: Exactly
9/14/21, 8:38 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Lol 😂 😂... Let's say its cause you started from java... No new beginner will pick java over python... 


Plus the range of things you could get done with python...
9/14/21, 8:40 PM - +232 99 783218: Java can do all too.

I started with Python, but I had to switch to Java and everything went well to learn the concepts

9/14/21, 11:20 PM - +234 814 775 1998: I thought I was the only one on this table. There's a reason most Universities teach Java first and not python.
9/15/21, 3:58 AM - +232 99 783218: They are looking for fullstack dev
9/15/21, 4:02 AM - +232 99 783218: 😁😁 I like Java a lot, but it have hardly touch it since last year
9/15/21, 8:01 AM - +234 902 396 6260: That was my first thought on reading the qualifications. Experience in server-side templating languages, design server-side architecture, SQl/noSql. Nah, recruiters ate wilding for real.
9/15/21, 8:02 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹😹 but their description states that they want a frontend dev
9/15/21, 8:06 AM - +234 902 396 6260: That's the main problem frontend devs face. I see these ads and I have headache, like I don't want to have business with database unless to integrate them into the client-side.
9/15/21, 8:06 AM - +234 902 396 6260: So much for specialization.
9/15/21, 8:11 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹😹 that's why I only go into a field I like.

Specialization is crazy in our world
9/15/21, 8:13 AM - +234 902 396 6260: By the way, I want to start learning user verification and authorizing. Any resources or advice??
9/15/21, 8:13 AM - +234 808 982 8929: Learn jwt or passportjs
9/15/21, 8:14 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok, thanks.
9/15/21, 11:38 AM - +234 814 775 1998: Me too. I haven't touched it since 2019 😅😅
9/15/21, 11:39 AM - +232 99 783218: 😹🤣🤣🤣
9/15/21, 12:55 PM - +234 809 964 8921: Hello guys...

I need to ask a newbie question.

So the stuff is I've been learning CSS for some weeks now.

I've not learnt Flexbox, Grid and Responsive (I'll still learn them)

I've learnt only layouts and display

But I think I'm watching too much tutorials.

I want to build something little with what I've learnt so far...


How should I proceed?

What can I build with my little knowledge?

Or is it too early to build?
9/15/21, 12:56 PM - +232 99 783218: You should build even if its only HTML, try build a website like Facebook login page in the simplest form
9/15/21, 12:59 PM - +234 809 964 8921: Thank you for this idea!
9/15/21, 1:01 PM - +234 809 964 8921: This message was deleted
9/15/21, 1:02 PM - Eke: I'll say learn flexbox first and then buid a simple project like @23299783218Don't use floats to build layouts. It's a total waste of time IMHO.
9/15/21, 1:02 PM - +234 814 003 5918: I will advice you to move to flex box and grid and resp cus it’s important and since you have started watching tutorials for weeks , you should have touched those topics and start practicing dem
9/15/21, 1:04 PM - +234 902 396 6260: The best way to learn is to build. Watch tutorials a bit, make mistakes and try to correct those mistakes, then you won't make them again.
9/15/21, 2:14 PM - +232 99 783218: no wahala
9/15/21, 2:15 PM - +232 99 783218: he needs to see the struggle of the past and appreciate the present.

I would have used two *section* and then change them to inline🤣🤣
9/15/21, 2:21 PM - Eke: Lol.. 😅 Floats is not worth learning, to be honest. I spent a long time trying to understand how it works. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Something I don't use any more.
9/15/21, 2:24 PM - +232 99 783218: I only tried it once, then I stopped learning it totally...

That was what forced me to learn Media Queries and then later Flexbox
9/15/21, 3:01 PM - Eke: Learn grid and become a CSS champion.
9/15/21, 3:18 PM - +234 903 644 9958: 💪
9/15/21, 3:33 PM - +232 99 783218: 😌😌I learned some of it but i still hardly use it🤣🤣

The most used is the *grid-template-columns*🤣
9/15/21, 4:41 PM - Eke: For everyone. 🌚💯

I installed pandas on my pycharm and when I want it to create data frame for me.... It'll yell attribute error..
9/15/21, 5:12 PM - +234 806 863 7325: More like... The module dataframe isnt in pandas...
9/15/21, 5:17 PM - +232 99 783218: Hmmmm, how come
9/15/21, 5:23 PM - +234 806 863 7325: Exactly... I'm like... How come also
9/15/21, 5:24 PM - +234 814 775 1998: Have you tried Tailwind?
9/15/21, 6:29 PM - +232 99 783218: Nope, I hardly use any CSS framework.

If I was to use, I would always choose bulma.io
9/15/21, 8:48 PM - +234 806 863 7325: 👆🏼... Please guys
9/15/21, 9:09 PM - +263 78 012 5519: I have faced the same problem countless times. I failed to fix it even using youtube solutions. I later switched to vscode and it works wonders. Try vscode

9/16/21, 6:21 AM - +232 99 783218: I prefer bulma.io because its simple, easy to use, and also its only CSS.

so I can write my JavaScript anyhow I want to.

The only disadvantage currently is that it doesn't have Grid system.

but you can still do some complex layouts
9/16/21, 7:34 AM - +254 714 586891: Nicee🔥
9/16/21, 7:48 AM - Eke: No grid?
9/16/21, 7:48 AM - Eke: <Media omitted>
9/16/21, 8:25 AM - +232 99 783218: nope, but they have a workaround with Flexbox
9/16/21, 8:29 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Good morning @23299783218. I've a little issue. I tried deploying a React site and it was giving a 404 error at first and when it eventually found the index.html file, it was blank. When I ran "serve -s build" from my editor, it worked fine. Any advice??
9/16/21, 8:39 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️I wish I could be of help, but I know nothing about React😁

I have always preferred Sveltejs
9/16/21, 8:39 AM - +232 99 783218: how are you btw
9/16/21, 8:40 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Where are you trying to deploy it?
9/16/21, 8:40 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I'm good.
9/16/21, 8:41 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I tried netlify, vercel and github pages, same issue.
9/16/21, 8:43 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Okay manually push your work to GitHub aside the built file, then you connect your netlify to github and click on deploy site . Ensure you have the gitignore file to ignore the node modules
9/16/21, 8:44 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok.
9/16/21, 8:45 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Wait, the build file doesn't even show on github.
9/16/21, 8:49 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Yes , don’t push the build file, delete it before you push

9/16/21, 8:55 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Normal levels.
9/16/21, 8:56 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Straight up
9/16/21, 9:02 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤣🤣🤣fact, our world is a special kind of crazy
9/16/21, 9:04 AM - +234 902 396 6260: <Media omitted>
9/16/21, 9:06 AM - +234 814 003 5918: There’s error with your favicon, check the file and maybe remove it entirely if you don’t use it
9/16/21, 9:06 AM - +234 814 003 5918: It can be affecting the deployment
9/16/21, 9:07 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Is your files on github ? I mean if you successfully pushed to gethub?
9/16/21, 9:07 AM - +234 814 003 5918: GitHub *
9/16/21, 9:07 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Yes.
9/16/21, 9:08 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Great, check the favicon, if you not using it remove it entirely also remove from your index file

Coding4Integrity: African Youth Anti-Corruption Hackathon
 
Date: 4 – 31 October, 2021
 
www.coding4integrity.com
 
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is
looking for the most talented coders to inspire us with their ideas on how tech can help fight corruption and advance peace, justice and strong institutions!
 
1. About the Hackathon
The African Youth Anti-Corruption Hackathon is a virtual 4 week technology challenge organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in partnership with private and public sector organizations in five African countries, namely Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa.

The objectives of the hackathon are to promote the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) to prevent and combat corruption in Africa and to give young developers the chance to come up with their own ideas on how to counter corruption through technologies. The challenge will also promote the implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) by enhancing public-private partnerships in the development of sustainable ICT-based anti-corruption solutions; youth engagement and employment; innovation and technology.

The winning teams will have the opportunity to further develop their technology solutions with the support of the public sector partners of the hackathon that seek to increase the use of ICT solutions as part of their domestic anti-corruption efforts.

In particular, the hackathon seeks to deliver the following outcomes in the participating countries:
• Increased advocacy and youth engagement in the fight against corruption;
• Increased youth employment, innovation and technology;
• Increased public-private partnerships;
• Increased efficiency and effectiveness in public administration and service delivery;
• Increased transparency, accountability and accessibility to state and public services.
2. Who are we looking for?
The hackathon is open to young creative people who:
✓ are between the age of 18 and 35;
✓ have basic coding skills and some experience with one or more development technologies;
✓ are nationals of Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa;
✓ have knowledge of Java, Javascript, C++, Python;
✓ are proficient in English;
✓ are passionate about using their tech skills to design digitally innovative solutions to promote integrity and tackle corruption in their countries.
Female candidates are particularly encouraged to apply for the hackathon.
 
3. Thematic Areas
The hackathon participants will be challenged to develop an ICT-based idea or solution that address one or more of the following themes:
1) Transparency in public administration, for instance non-cash-based payments and traceability;
2) Safe and reliable reporting of corruption (whistle-blowing promotion and protection);
3) Transparency in public procurement and the administration of public finances, with a focus on the health sector;
4) Financial investigation solutions ;
5) Other areas relevant to UNCAC.
4. Teams and tracks

The hackathon participants will be grouped in teams of four members. The application form allows participants to apply either individually or as a team. The individual applicants will be grouped in teams during the first week of the hackathon.

Each team will work in one of the following tracks based on the type of technology that the team will create:
Track 1: Blockchain Dapp developing
Track 2: AI developing
Track 3: Web2 developing  
5. Hackathon Programme

The hackathon will be held virtually on Untap-Compete.com and Microsoft Teams. Registered participants will receive confirmation of their successful application by 27 September 2021.

The hackathon will officially commence on 4 October 2021. Subsequently, the hackathon participants will be engaged in one week of ideation and team formation, two weeks of coding with the final submissions being made by 27 October 2021. 

The hackathon winners will be announced on 31 October 2021.

Mentorship, product development, ideation and technical webinars will be organized in the course of the hackathon.
6. Award

The winning teams will be invited to present their projects and ideas to the Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (COSP), which will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in December 2021. The COSP will bring together anti-corruption experts from more than 180 countries and will serve as a great opportunity for the winning teams to promote and seek further support for the development of their ICT-based solutions.  

UNODC will cover the travel and accommodation for the winning teams in accordance with the UN travel regulations.

9/20/21, 12:29 PM - Williams: 2021 to 2030: WHAT WILL HAPPEN & HOW YOU SHOULD POSITION YOURSELF

For 2021...

You will need 7 Masteries

Or 7 Competencies

Or 7 Skills

2021 will be a tougher year.

Only Masters will survive.

The next 10 years will be a revolutionary decade.

The world will evolve. Fully. It will go Digital. There will be 5G and 6G and 7G.

The Internet Of Things will be completed. 

The disparity between the rich and the poor will widen. 

There will be no middle class.

You will either be poor or rich.

Money will become purely digital. Bitcoin. Altcoin. Tokens. Community Coin. 

I mean the real money will be Digital. 

Money will become value exchange. 

Money will be shared only within communities. Virtual, especially. 

Money will be made only based on:  

The Value you create

The Value you add

The Problems you solve

The Solutions you provide through your expertise

The Products and services you will be able to sell

The wealth formula for the next 10 years will be 👇🏾

VVF

V - Value

V - Volume

F - Frequency

Create VALUE. Think in terms of VOLUME. And do this FREQUENTLY. 

So for 2021, you have got  to understand the following differences:

1. Information
2. Education
3. Knowledge
4. Application
5. Mastery/Skill

INFORMATION : Value Data. Usable bits. You will make progress these next 10 years based on the updates and useful information you have access to. 

EDUCATION : Organized information put together by dead people and taught mostly in our schools. The certificate will give you some access. But formal education is not enough. 

KNOWLEDGE : Knowledge is Sequential, Structured, Functional and Relevant information

The persons who will help you transform information to knowledge is called Teacher.

There are 3 kinds of Teachers you should be having:

1. Role Models 
2. Mentors
3. Coaches

Role Models have your gifts in advance state or your idea in advance state.

You know role models but they don't know you.

Role Models are Living Knowledge

You observe them and learn from them from a distance.

Mentors are similar to role models but they have a relationship with you

You know them and they know you.

The difference between a role model and a mentor in your life is the relationship you have with the mentor

Coaches don't necessarily have the qualities you have but have the ability to bring the best in you.

You know the coach. And the coach knows you.

The Coach may not have your expertise or Vision but he is positioned to bring out the best in you.

While a Mentor and Role Model will INSPIRE you. A Coach will INSTRUCT you
These 3 Teachers help you convert Information into Knowledge

Your information about life is not enough. This information needs to be organized, structured, and epitomized by these 3 Teachers.

APPLICATION:

The world rarely pays you for what you know. They pay you for what you do.

The world admires professors but they pay professionals.

Professors accumulate knowledge. Professionals apply knowledge.

MASTERY /SKILL

☝🏽 This is where we are going

Information, education, knowledge and application are quite important.... But none will help you in the next 10 years more than Mastery

Your certificate will give you access for the job interview

Your KNOWLEDGE will give you the Job. 

But it's your SKILL that will give you promotion and keep you at the job when the going is tough or when the organization is downsizing.

In the next 10 years, there will be

A lot of mergers and acquisition

Downsizings

Technological advances and innovation

Artificial intelligence taking human jobs.

You need

Survival Skills
Navigation Skills &
Global Skills.

You will need MULTIPLE SKILLS

You will need to have a SKILL RANGE 

So that no matter what happens, you have another skill to select and survive.

You will also need a SKILL SET 

SKILL RANGE means multiple But DIFFERENT SKILLS . SKILL SETS  means multiple but COMPLIMENTARY skills

Skill is Application done repeatedly

Skill is application done habitually

Skill is taking consistent actions with improvement at the back of your mind

Skill is really not consistency. Skill is consistency in improvement

So as I conclude, let's look at the 7 Masteries

These 7 Masteries are not information, education, knowledge or one off application.

These 7 Masteries are Skills and Competencies.

Between 2021 and 2030 master them

Mastery 1: *Visioneering*

VISIONEERING is *The ability to Convert Thoughts To Things.*

It's the engineering of visions into reality.

It's the ability to make what you have in your mind get to your hand

It's all that goes into

CONCEPTUALIZATION
Articulation
& Actualization

Do you have ideas and make them real?

How often do you get this done?

On scale of 1 - 10 how do you rate yourself in terms of making your ideas happen(Visioneering)

Mastery 2: *Communication*

Communication is your ability to

Connect
Cast
Convince.

Mastery 3: *Leadership*

Leadership as a skill will help you *multiply your success*

Leadership as a skill will help you *multiply your success*

Leadership *is your ability to duplicate or replicate your effort and multiply your results through team work.*

Leadership is influence that leads to affluence.

Leadership is effective delegation. Effectively matching roles with talents.

Leadership is reproduction. Reproducing yourself

Mastery 4: *Selling*

In the next 10 years, you will want to master selling.

In the next 10 years, you will want to master selling.

You won't make money if you don't sell.

Don't master selling to one person. *Master selling to many*

One to One. One to Many.

One to One is one-on-one Prospecting. One to Many is very often *Digital Marketing*

Digital Marketing is must learn and master for the next 10 years.

Take all your projects and businesses online.

There will be many more diseases like Covid-19.

Virtual Connections and Marketing will save you from bankruptcy.

Also, you want to master *branding* , *packaging* and *promotions* the tripartite strategies for business success

Mastery 5: *Financial Intelligence & Mastery*

Mastery 6: *GoalSetting & Activity Management*

Mastery 7: *Personal Mastery*

What does personal Mastery mean?

It means Personal Discovery + Personal Development

It means handling your *emotions*

Personal Mastery is a skill not readily available and so anyone who has it, will be hot 🎂 cake!

How do you handle situations?

How do you handle disappointment?

How do you handle success?

Do you allow success to get into your head or failure to attack your heart?

So these are the 7 Masteries

1. Visioneering
2. Communication
3. Leadership
4. Selling
5. Financial Intelligence and Mastery
6. GoalSetting & Activity Management
7. Personal Mastery

Scale yourself 1 to 10.

1 being poor and 10 being excellent.

Determine where you are at the moment.

Then make up your mind that the year 2021 is the year of *Upgrade*

For example, if you are on 4 in Visioneering, make up your mind to step up to 6 or 7

Look for books on all these 7.

Look for mentors in these 7 areas.


Attend virtual and physical training in these areas.  Copied!!

It creates your resume and you can download it. 

Once you create an account a portfolio domain is automatically created.

Here is the link to the project https://portfolio-resume-builder.herokuapp.com/

Today, I'm guessing everyone is taking a break from coding.

Do you recall the anonymous feedback project? where you can receive anonymous messages and have no idea who sent them?

Yes, it's still live, why not send me an anonymous message about what you like or dislike about me, also include what you want me to improve on or drop which you might not want to tell me in person. 

you can also create your own link and share it with your friends to know what they think about you.

don't forget to report bugs and give feedback about the project.

It's going to be fun

Here's my own link: https://anonymousfeedback.tk/to/unclebigbay

9/27/21, 5:06 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Hi guys
I am trying to use github pages to host my website but it always doesn't find the page.It says 404. Even on netlify.What could be the problem?
9/27/21, 5:52 AM - +234 903 644 9958: One, the naming of your file.

Github pages have some king on config. Like base and docs.

Base config means your index file should be in the base directory. 

And Docs is creating a folder and putting your codes there for GitHub to find that path
9/27/21, 5:52 AM - +234 903 644 9958: Netlify, also have some setting like base directory publish directory and stuffs like.

I just feel one the major cause the configurations
9/27/21, 7:10 AM - +234 902 396 6260: First of all, did you use a framework??
9/27/21, 9:17 AM - +234 808 475 2572: The index file is actually in a folder where other files are
9/27/21, 9:17 AM - +234 808 475 2572: No I didn't
9/27/21, 10:02 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok then, did you specify an index.html file. Web servers look for the index.html as the base directory. So you have to make sure the landing/home page is an index.html or else it will return a 404 error.
9/27/21, 11:58 AM - +234 808 475 2572: Everything is there o
I specified the home page as index
9/27/21, 12:00 PM - Eke: Send a screenshot of your project directory. I think that's the best way to know what's wrong.
9/27/21, 12:01 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Ok then. Send a screenshot of your directory. If you put the index.html file in a folder that's not the root folder, then you'll get a 404 unless you specified a path.
9/27/21, 12:02 PM - +234 902 396 6260: Yup.

9/27/21, 7:57 PM - +234 902 396 6260: One advise I give to people - keep all your html files in the root directory or in the same folder, so you don't have to "./page.html", you just go "page.html".
9/27/21, 8:50 PM - Eke: What was the issue?
9/27/21, 9:22 PM - +234 808 475 2572: The index was in a folder

9/28/21, 10:20 AM - +234 806 863 7325: How can an intern be very experienced.... Instead of intern.. Wouldn't the person just search for jobs
9/28/21, 10:25 AM - Emmanuel (UG): Simce when did Reactjs, vuejs and nodejs become programming languages 🤦🏿‍♂️
9/28/21, 10:25 AM - +234 814 003 5918: How can an intern have basic knowledge of java php Python, infact de could have called all programming languages in tech, Omo naija tech firms are funny 😄
9/28/21, 10:25 AM - Emmanuel (UG): Also feels like they are looking for someone naive to exploit 🤣🤣
9/28/21, 10:26 AM - Emmanuel (UG): 🤣
9/28/21, 10:29 AM - +254 727 870371: This requirements aren't given by HR though. Mostly it's team leads
9/28/21, 10:30 AM - +254 727 870371: Not just naija but everywhere
9/28/21, 10:36 AM - +234 905 802 8858: I need to fetch api from google
9/28/21, 10:38 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Whether team leads or not, HR is supposed to manage the employees, right?? Then they should know when something is off. Can the chief electrician put "must know how to cut grass" as a requirement to hire a new electrician and the HR would just put it out without question?? If they knew about tech, then they wouldn't just paste ads anyhow.
9/28/21, 10:38 AM - Gold: That's not a new thing
9/28/21, 10:40 AM - Gold: Maybe they need a front end dev

9/28/21, 10:41 AM - Gold: Haha they're always looking for someone
9/28/21, 10:42 AM - +234 902 396 6260: I once saw a tweet about a certain framework which has been out for less than 2 years but the HR wanted a person with 3 years experience.
9/28/21, 10:57 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Exactly my point

9/28/21, 11:00 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Worse case... Is... They won't even want to pay...
9/28/21, 11:00 AM - +234 902 396 6260: It was the creator that actually applief, made it known and brought it to Twitter.
9/28/21, 11:00 AM - +234 806 863 7325: Imagine saying they needed a fullstack dev engineer with 7years experience for 200k... No be juju be that

9/28/21, 12:10 PM - +234 902 396 6260: And it all totally depends on the kinda contract signed.

9/29/21, 9:44 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Sometimes to be designing makes me feel like I’m spending much time when I have more important logic coding to do, anyone else feel same way? And how do you handle that? React developer ish
9/29/21, 10:06 AM - +232 99 783218: 😹🤣🤣 That's the worse part for me.

but i still strive to improve my designs. And I end up wasting time 😭
9/29/21, 10:25 AM - +234 814 003 5918: People see a site and see wow the design is fine, no one talks about the functionality, which is even the hardest part and the backend work 😫
9/29/21, 10:51 AM - +232 99 783218: 🤣😹😹yeah, we are the ghost of everything.

but i love it more, less stress

9/29/21, 11:55 AM - +234 814 003 5918: Wow really lol
9/29/21, 3:43 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I was wondering, cos I've never had to approve a pull request before, during a contribution to a website for example, how does one visually check to see the effect of someone else's changes on the website? Cos I imagine that the pull request would come with only the code changes right?
9/29/21, 3:47 PM - +234 903 644 9958: For me I clone the repo/branch where the pull request was made and i test it locally
9/29/21, 3:48 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ohh ok this makes sense. Thanks
9/29/21, 3:48 PM - +234 903 644 9958: 🙏
9/29/21, 3:51 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Come to think of it. Isn't that going to get tiresome to do for every change made by one person or even multiple changes by different people?
9/29/21, 3:58 PM - +234 903 644 9958: Get a develop branch where pull request can be Merged and tested, before merged maybe to the main or master branch
9/29/21, 4:04 PM - +234 812 077 2330: A develop branch? I'm kinda lost here. I might need more explanation about this or better yet a practical session to see how this really works🤔
9/29/21, 4:11 PM - +232 99 783218: some hosting sites like netlify and vercel have a preview feature
9/29/21, 4:13 PM - +234 812 077 2330: To check a change done on a repo before a merge? How does it work?
9/29/21, 4:15 PM - +234 812 077 2330: I'm about to sit down with this thing, this is a real brain scratcher for me right now.

9/29/21, 4:20 PM - +234 903 644 9958: Create a second branch and add an instruction in a contributing.md file that all pull request should be made  to that specific branch.

Then that branch would be a second branch, that would  be for testing only
9/29/21, 4:23 PM - +234 812 077 2330: Ok I get it now
9/29/21, 4:23 PM - +234 903 644 9958: 🙏
9/29/21, 4:24 PM - +232 99 783218: I haven't tested it yet but I saw it on a repo I contribute to.

and I also saw the option on netlify

10/1/21, 10:51 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Did you point the base directory to your build folder?? That's usually the problem, your index.html file isn't seen by the web server.
10/1/21, 10:52 AM - Segun: The server folder?
10/1/21, 10:53 AM - +234 816 261 7119: You can try viewing the real-time functions log to see what is causing the problem

10/1/21, 10:56 AM - +234 902 396 6260: Your directory should have a public folder, right?? That's where your index.html file should be.

How about contributing any profile of Nigeria president from 1960 till date, don't think about President Buhari's profile because I have made the pull request of his profile.
